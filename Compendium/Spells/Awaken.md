Animal or tree gains human intellect.

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 5
*   **Components:** V, S, DF, XP
*   **Casting Time:** 24 hours

*   **Effect:** Animal or tree touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).

The *awakened* animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.

An *awakened* tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An *awakened* plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.

An *awakened* animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

An *awakened* tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

*XP Cost:* 250 XP.
