<p><i>Erase</i> removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove <i>explosive runes,</i> a <i>glyph of warding.</i> a <i>sepia snake sigil,</i> or an <i>arcane mark</i>, but not <i>illusory script</i> or a <i>symbol</i> spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.</p><p>Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase <i>explosive runes</i>, a <i>glyph of warding</i>, or a <i>sepia snake sigil</i>, you accidentally activate that writing instead.</p>
