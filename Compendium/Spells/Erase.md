- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

### Description

Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove [[Explosive Runes]], a [[Glyph of Warding]], a [[Sepia Snake Sigil]], or an [[Arcane Mark]], but not [[Illusory Script]] or a Symbol spell. 

Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a **caster level check** (1d20 + caster level) against **DC 15**. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) 

If you fail to erase [[Explosive Runes]], a [[Glyph of Warding]], or a [[Sepia Snake Sigil]], you **accidentally activate that writing** instead.
