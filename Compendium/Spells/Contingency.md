Sets trigger condition for another spell.

*   Evocation
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6
*   **Components:** V, S, M, F
*   **Casting Time:** At least 10 minutes; see text

*   **Saving Throw:** Non spécifié

<p>You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting <i>contingency</i>. The <i>contingency</i> spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead.</p><p>The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency</i> must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p><p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency</i> immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency</i> and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.</p><p>You can use only one <i>contingency</i> spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> That of the companion spell, plus quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, rakshasa, or similar spell-using creature.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A statuette of you carved from elephant ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp). You must carry the focus for the <i>contingency</i> to work.</p>
