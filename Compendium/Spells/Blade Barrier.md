## Blade Barrier

Touch attack deals 1d6/level damage (max 15d6).

*   Evocation [Force]
*   **Level:** Clr 6, Good 6, War 6
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** Wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft./level long, or ringed wall of radius up to 5 ft./2 levels; both 20 ft. high
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

An immobile vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are standing, each such creature takes damage as if passing through the wall unless it succeeds on a Reflex save â€” in which case it takes no damage and chooses which side of the wall to occupy.

A *blade barrier* provides cover against attacks made through it:
- +4 bonus to AC
- +2 bonus on Reflex saves
