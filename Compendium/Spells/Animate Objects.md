## Animate Objects

Objects attack your foes.

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 6, Chaos 6, Clr 6
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** One Small object per caster level; see text
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None

You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.

An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.

*Animate objects* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.
