<p>Any iron or iron alloy item you touch becomes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.</p><p>You may employ <i>rusting grasp</i> in combat with a successful melee touch attack. <i>Rusting grasp</i> used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) through corrosion.</p><p>Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.</p><p>Against a ferrous creature, <i>rusting grasp</i> instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.</p><p> </p>
