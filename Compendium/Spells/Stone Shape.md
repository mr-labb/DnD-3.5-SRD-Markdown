<p>You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with <i>stone shape,</i> fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> Soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone while the verbal component is uttered.</p>
