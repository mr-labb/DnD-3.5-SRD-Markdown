<p><i>Magic weapon</i> gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.)</p><p>You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see <i>magic fang</i>). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.</p>
