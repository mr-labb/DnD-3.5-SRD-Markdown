<p>You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness.</p><p>Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p><p>The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal,</i> but <i>remove curse</i> is effective.</p><p>The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.</p>
