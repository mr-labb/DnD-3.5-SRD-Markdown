## Detect Snares and Pits

Reveals natural or primitive traps.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Divination  
- **Level:** Drd 1, Rgr 1  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** 60 ft.  
- **Effect:** Cone-shaped emanation  
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

### Description

You detect simple pits, deadfalls, snares, and mechanical traps built from natural materials. The spell does not reveal complex mechanisms, trapdoor traps, or other sophisticated constructions.

It does detect certain natural hazards, such as:
- Quicksand (considered a snare)  
- Sinkholes (considered pits)  
- Unsafe natural rock formations (deadfalls)  

However, it does not identify other dangerous conditions or magical traps unless they mimic a snaring, pit, or falling hazard (e.g., see [[Snare]] spell). Safe or deactivated traps are also undetectable by this spell.

### Information by Round

- **1st Round:** Presence or absence of hazards  
- **2nd Round:** Number and location of hazards; if not visible, reveals only direction  
- **Each Additional Round:** General type and triggering mechanism of one closely examined hazard

You may change direction each round to examine a new area. The spell penetrates most barriers but is blocked by:
- 1 foot of stone  
- 1 inch of common metal  
- A thin sheet of lead  
- 3 feet of wood or dirt
