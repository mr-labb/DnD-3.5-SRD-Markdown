Weapon strikes true against evil foes.

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Pal 1
*   **Components:** V, S

This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for:
- Bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures
- Striking evil incorporeal creatures  
> Note: This spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus.

The weapon also gains the *good* alignment:
- Bypasses DR of certain creatures
- Suppresses any other alignment it may have

Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted. However, projectile weapons (e.g. bows) do not confer this benefit to ammunition.

Additionally, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful:
- Every threat becomes a confirmed critical hit
- This does *not* apply to weapons with magical effects related to crits (e.g. *keen*, *vorpal*)
