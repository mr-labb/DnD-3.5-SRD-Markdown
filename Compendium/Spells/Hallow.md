### Description

*Hallow* makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects:

1. The site is guarded by a [[Magic Circle Against Evil]] effect.

2. All Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to [[command undead]] take a â€“4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.  
   *Note:* This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.

3. Any dead body interred in a *hallowed* site cannot be turned into an undead creature.

4. You may choose to fix a single spell effect to the *hallowed* site.  
   - The spell effect lasts for **one year**  
   - Applies throughout the entire site regardless of its normal duration and area  
   - You may designate whether the effect applies to:
     - All creatures  
     - Creatures who share your faith or alignment  
     - Creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment  
   - The effect can be **renewed or replaced** by casting *Hallow* again

Eligible spell effects include:  
[[Aid]], [[Bane]], [[Bless]], [[Cause Fear]], [[Darkness]], [[Daylight]], [[Death Ward]], [[Deeper Darkness]], [[Detect Evil]], [[Detect Magic]], [[Dimensional Anchor]], [[Discern Lies]], [[Dispel Magic]], [[Endure Elements]], [[Freedom of Movement]], [[Invisibility Purge]], [[Protection from Energy]], [[Remove Fear]], [[Resist Energy]], [[Silence]], [[Tongues]], [[Zone of Truth]]

Saving throws and spell resistance may apply to these effects; see individual spell descriptions.

Only one *Hallow* spell (and its associated effect) may be active in an area at a time.  
*Hallow* counters but does not dispel [[Unhallow]].

### Material Component

Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least **1,000 gp**, plus **1,000 gp per level** of the spell to be included in the *hallowed* area.
