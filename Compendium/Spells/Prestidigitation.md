## Description

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a *Prestidigitation* spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations.

The spell can:
- Slowly lift 1 pound of material  
- Color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round  
- Chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material  

It cannot:
- Deal damage  
- Affect the concentration of spellcasters  
- Duplicate effects of other spells  

*Prestidigitation* can create small objects, but they appear crude and artificial. Materials created this way are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Any actual change to an object (beyond moving, cleaning, or soiling) lasts only 1 hour.
