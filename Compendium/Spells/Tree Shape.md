## Tree Shape

You look exactly like a tree for 1 hour/level.

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Drd 2, Rgr 3  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal  
- **Effect:** You  
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** Not specified  
- **Spell Resistance:** Not specified  

By means of this spell, you assume the form of a **Large living tree or shrub**, or a **Large dead tree trunk** with a few limbs. Even close inspection cannot reveal the disguiseâ€”only a [[Detect Magic]] spell reveals a faint aura of transmutation.

- While in tree form:
  - You **retain all senses** and awareness  
  - Your **hit points and saves remain unchanged**  
  - Gain **+10 natural armor bonus to AC**  
  - Dexterity becomes **0**, speed becomes **0 ft.**  
  - You are **immune to critical hits**  
  - Your **clothing and gear transform** with you

You can **dismiss Tree Shape as a free action**.
