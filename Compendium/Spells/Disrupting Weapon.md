## Disrupting Weapon

Melee weapon destroys undead.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Clr 5  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** One melee weapon  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object); see text  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)  

### Description

You imbue a melee weapon with [[divine power]], turning it into a bane against the undead. When wielded against an undead creature:

- If the target’s **Hit Dice (HD) ≤ your caster level**, it must make a **Will save**  
- On a **failed save**, the undead is **instantly destroyed**  
- The **destruction effect bypasses spell resistance**, making it especially potent

This enchantment is ideal for clerics and champions of the divine who face persistent undead threats. Note that the weapon remains usable by others during the effect’s duration but still only affects undead as described.
