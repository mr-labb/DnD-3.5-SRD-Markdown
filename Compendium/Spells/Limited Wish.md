<p>A <i>limited wish</i> lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a <i>limited wish</i> can do any of the following things.</p><list> <li>Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li> <li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li> <li>Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.</li> <li>Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.</li> <li>Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>insanity</i>.</li> <li>Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.</li> </list><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a <i>limited wish</i> duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a <i>limited wish</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component.</p><p><i>XP Cost:</i> 300 XP or more (see above).</p>
