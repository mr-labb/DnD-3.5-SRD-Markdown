## Limited Wish

Alters reality — within spell limits.

### Spell Details

- **School**: Universal  
- **Level**: Sor/Wiz 7  
- **Components**: V, S, XP  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: See text  
- **Effect**: See text  
- **Duration**: See text  
- **Saving Throw**: None; see text  
- **Spell Resistance**: Yes  

### Description

A *limited wish* lets you create nearly any type of effect. Example uses include:

- Duplicate any Sorcerer/Wizard spell of 6th level or lower (non-prohibited school)  
- Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower (non-prohibited school)  
- Duplicate any Sorcerer/Wizard spell of 5th level or lower (even if prohibited)  
- Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower (even if prohibited)  
- Undo harmful effects of spells such as [[Geas_Quest|Geas/Quest]] or [[Insanity]]  
- Produce other effects comparable in power (e.g., one creature automatically hits on its next attack, or suffers a –7 penalty to its next saving throw)

Duplicated spells allow saving throws and spell resistance as normal (save DC is for a 7th-level spell).

If duplicating a spell with an XP cost:
- You must pay either that cost or **300 XP**, whichever is higher.

If duplicating a spell with a material component costing more than **1,000 gp**, you must supply that component.

### XP Cost

300 XP or more (see above).
