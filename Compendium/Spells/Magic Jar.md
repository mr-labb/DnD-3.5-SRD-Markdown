### Description

By casting *Magic Jar*, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (the *magic jar*), leaving your body lifeless. You can then attempt to possess a nearby body, sending its soul into the jar. You can return to the jar to release the soul and try another body. The spell ends when you return your soul to your original body.

- The jar must be **within range** and **known to you** (no line of sight needed)  
- Your body appears dead when the spell is cast  
- While in the jar, you can sense and attack any life force within **10 ft. per caster level** (on the same plane), requiring **line of effect**  
  - You cannot identify creature type or position  
  - You can sense if a creature is powered by **positive or negative energy**  
  - You can detect differences of **4+ HD** between life forces  
  - Selection of targets (stronger/weaker) is **randomized**

**Possession mechanics**:
- Attempting to possess is a **full-round action**  
- Blocked by [[Protection from Evil]] and similar wards  
- Target must fail a **Will save** for possession to succeed  
- Failed possession locks you out from future attempts on that body  
- If successful:
  - You gain mental traits: **Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, class, BAB, saves, alignment**  
  - The body retains: **Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, HP, natural abilities**  
  - You cannot use **extra limbs**, **extra attacks**, or **extraordinary/supernatural abilities**  
  - Spells and spell-like abilities do **not** transfer

**Returning or transferring**:
- Standard action to return to the jar  
- Spell ends when you return to your original body  
- If host body is slain:
  - If within range, you return to the jar  
  - If out of range, you **die**, and the hostâ€™s soul is lost  
- If the spell ends while in jar/host:
  - You return to your body (or die if it is not available)  
  - Other soul returns to its body (or dies if unavailable)

**Dispelling and destruction**:
- The receptacle can be **destroyed** or the spell **dispelled** either at the jar or host location

### Focus

A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.
