This spell functions like <i>[[symbol of death]]</i>, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the <i>symbol of sleep</i> instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6x10 minutes. Unlike with the <i>sleep</i> spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of sleep</i> has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <i>symbol of sleep</i> simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

<i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of sleep</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a <i>symbol of sleep</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for <i>symbol of sleep</i>.

<i>Material Component:</i> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.</p>
