## Symbol of Sleep

Triggered rune puts nearby creatures into catatonic slumber.

This spell functions like [[Symbol of Death]], except that all **creatures of 10 HD or less** within 60 ft. of the **Symbol of Sleep** fall into a **catatonic slumber** for **3d6Ã—10 minutes**. Unlike with the *Sleep* spell, affected creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means until the duration ends.

Once triggered, the symbol stays active for **10 minutes per caster level**, continuously affecting new qualifying targets. It has **no hit point limit**.

- Only rogues can attempt this  
- *[[Dispel Magic]]* removes the symbol  
- *[[Erase]]* is ineffective  
- Destroying the surface **triggers** the symbol  

**Material Component:** Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth at least 1,000 gp.
