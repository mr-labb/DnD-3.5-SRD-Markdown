## Symbol of Death

Triggered rune slays nearby creatures.

A **Symbol of Death** is a powerful magical rune inscribed on a surface. When triggered, it instantly slays one or more creatures within 60 ft., up to a total of 150 HP, starting with the closest. It lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until its HP limit is reached.

Creatures entering the area while the symbol is active must save as well, but only once per entry unless they leave and return. The symbol is visible at a distance and must be placed in plain sight to function. It can be triggered by actions like looking at it, reading, touching, crossing over, or passing through a portal with itâ€”only within 60 ft. It cannot be hidden to function unless uncovered.

Custom triggers and passwords can be set to prevent activation. Attunement options exist for individuals and groups (up to 25 creatures), making them immune to the symbol's effects. The caster is automatically attuned.

**Detection and Removal:**  
- *[[Read Magic]]* + DC 19 Spellcraft check identifies it  
- *[[Dispel Magic]]* can remove it  
- *[[Erase]]* does nothing  
- Destroying the surface triggers it  
- *[[Permanency]]* makes it last forever, reactivating after 10 minutes of downtime

**Note:** Magic traps like this are hard to detect and disable.  
- **Search and Disable Device DC:** 33 (25 + spell level)

**Material Component:** Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth 5,000 gp each.
