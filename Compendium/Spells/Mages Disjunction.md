## Mages Disjunction

Dispels magic, disenchants magic items.

### Spell Details

- **School**: Abjuration  
- **Level**: Magic 9, Sor/Wiz 9  
- **Components**: V  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect**: All magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst  
- **Duration**: Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw**: Will negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance**: No  

### Description

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined.

- Spells and spell-like effects are separated into individual components (ending as [[Dispel Magic]] does)  
- Each permanent magic item must succeed on a Will save or become a normal item  
- An item in a creature's possession uses the higher of its own or the possessor's Will save bonus

Additional effects:
- 1% chance per caster level to destroy an [[Antimagic Field]]  
  - If the field survives, no items within it are disjoined  
- Artifacts are subject to disjunction  
  - Only a 1% chance per caster level of affecting such items  
  - If destroyed, the caster must succeed on a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities  
    - These abilities cannot be restored by mortal magic, even by [[Miracle]] or [[Wish]]

**Note**: Destroying artifacts is dangerous and 95% likely to attract a powerful being with an interest in the device.
