## Mages Disjunction

Dispels magic, disenchants magic items.

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Magic 9, Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** All magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

<p>All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a <i>dispel magic</i> spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher.</p><p>You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <i>antimagic field.</i> If the <i>antimagic field</i> survives the <i>disjunction,</i> no items within it are disjoined.</p><p>Even artifacts are subject to <i>disjunction,</i> though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>.)</p><p><i>Note:</i> Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.</p>
