- **Components:** V, S, M/DF

- **Range:** Personal

When cast, *Spell Turning* deflects spells and spell-like abilities targeted at you directly—**not** area or effect spells, and it won’t block **touch spells** either.

- The number of spell levels turned is **1d4+6**, rolled secretly.
- If a spell's level exceeds your remaining turning capacity, the spell is only **partially reflected**.
  - For damage spells: damage is split proportionally between caster and target.
  - For non-damaging spells: each has a chance to be affected.
- If both caster and target have active *Spell Turning*, a **resonating field** may occur:

| d% Roll | Effect |
|--------:|:-------|
| 01–70   | Spell drains away harmlessly |
| 71–80   | Spell affects both parties equally |
| 81–97   | Both effects nullified for 1d4 minutes |
| 98–100  | Both casters are shunted to another plane |

- **Material Component:** A small silver mirror
