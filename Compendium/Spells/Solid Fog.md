## Solid Fog

Blocks vision and slows movement.

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 4  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect:** Fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high  
- **Duration:** 1 min./level  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

This spell functions like [[Fog Cloud]], but in addition to obscuring sight, the *Solid Fog* is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls.

The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into *Solid Fog* is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in *Solid Fog*.

However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

*Solid Fog* can be made permanent with a [[Permanency]] spell. A permanent *Solid Fog* dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

**Material Component:** A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.
