## Cloak of Chaos

+4 to AC, +4 resistance, SR 25 against lawful spells.

* **School:** Abjuration [Chaotic]  
* **Level:** Chaos 8, Clr 8  
* **Components:** V, S, F  
* **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
* **Range:** 20 ft.  
* **Effect:** One creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you  
* **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)  
* **Saving Throw:** See text  
* **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become *confused*. This abjuration has four effects:

1. Each warded creature gains a **+4 deflection bonus to AC** and a **+4 resistance bonus on saves**. Unlike *[[protection from law]]*, these benefits apply against **all attacks**, not just those from lawful creatures.

2. Each warded creature gains **spell resistance 25** against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

3. The abjuration **blocks possession and mental influence**, as *[[protection from law]]* does.

4. If a lawful creature successfully lands a **melee attack** against a warded target, the attacker becomes **confused for 1 round** (Will save negates, using this spellâ€™s save DC).

**Focus:** A tiny reliquary containing a sacred relic (e.g., a scrap of chaotic scripture), minimum cost: 500 gp.
