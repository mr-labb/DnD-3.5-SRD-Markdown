## Detect Magic

Detects spells and magic items within 60 ft.

### Description

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:

- **1st Round:** Presence or absence of magical auras  
- **2nd Round:** Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura  
- **3rd Round:** Strength and location of each aura. If items or creatures with auras are in line of sight, you may make Spellcraft checks to determine the school of magic (DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for nonspell effects)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

#### Aura Power

| Source      | Faint       | Moderate     | Strong       | Overwhelming |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Spell       | 0–3rd       | 4th–6th      | 7th–9th      | 10th+        |
| Magic item  | 1st–5th     | 6th–11th     | 12th–20th    | 21st+        |

If an aura qualifies for more than one category, the stronger is shown.

#### Lingering Aura

A magical aura may linger after its source is dispelled or destroyed:

| Original Strength | Lingering Duration     |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Faint             | 1d6 rounds             |
| Moderate          | 1d6 minutes            |
| Strong            | 1d6 × 10 minutes       |
| Overwhelming      | 1d6 days               |

Outsiders and elementals are not inherently magical, but summoned ones register due to the conjuration spell.

Each round, you may turn to scan a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but is blocked by:

- 1 foot of stone  
- 1 inch of common metal  
- A thin sheet of lead  
- 3 feet of wood or dirt

*Detect Magic* can be made permanent with a [[Permanency]] spell.
