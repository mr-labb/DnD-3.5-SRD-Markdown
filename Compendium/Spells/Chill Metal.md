The spell chills selected metal, dealing cold damage to creatures in contact with it:

- **Unattended, nonmagical metal**: no save  
- **Magical or attended metal**: saving throw allowed  
- Saving throw bonus uses creature’s if higher than object’s

### Damage Conditions

- **Full damage** (based on spell round):
  - If wearing affected metal armor
  - If holding/wearing/carrying metal ≥ 1/5 of body weight
- **Minimal damage** (1–2 points per round):
  - If wearing no metal armor
  - If metal < 1/5 of body weight

### Temperature & Damage by Round

| Round | Metal Temperature | Damage     |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| 1     | Cold              | None       |
| 2     | Icy               | 1d4 points |
| 3–5   | Freezing          | 2d4 points |
| 6     | Icy               | 1d4 points |
| 7     | Cold              | None       |

- **Heat sources** (fire, lava, etc.) negate cold damage point-for-point
- **Underwater**: no damage; ice forms on metal, making it more buoyant

### Spell Interaction

- *Chill Metal* **counters and dispels** [[Heat Metal]]
