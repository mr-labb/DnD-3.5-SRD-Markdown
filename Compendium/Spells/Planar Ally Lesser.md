### Description

By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice.  
If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment.  
You may also name a specific creature during casting, though the result may vary.

You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment.  
Tasks vary in complexity, and you must communicate with the creature to negotiate terms.

Payment options include:
- Donations (gold or magic items) to an allied temple  
- Gifts directly to the creature  
- Actions aligning with the creature’s goals or ethos  

Payment must be made **before** services begin.  
Negotiation takes at least 1 round, with the creature acting the following round.

**Payment Rates:**
- Short task (1 min./level): 100 gp × HD  
- Moderate task (1 hr./level): 500 gp × HD  
- Long task (1 day/level): 1,000 gp × HD  
- Nonhazardous task: Half normal payment  
- Hazardous task: May require additional compensation  
- Suicidal task: Typically refused unless strongly aligned with creature's ethos  

At the end of the task, or when the agreed duration ends, the creature returns to its home plane.  
It may report to you if possible.

**Note**: A calling spell that summons an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature is considered of that type.

### XP Cost

100 XP
