## Wall of Ice

Ice plane creates wall with 15 hp +1/level, or hemisphere can trap creatures inside.

- **School:** Evocation [Cold]  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 4

- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect:**  
  - Anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level

This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A *Wall of Ice* cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a *Wall of Ice*, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a *Wall of Ice* creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.

### Ice Plane

A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.

- Each 10-ft. square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.  
- A section of wall with 0 hp is breached.  
- Strength check DC to break through in one attack: 15 + caster level  

Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it takes 1d6 cold damage +1 per caster level (no save).

### Hemisphere

The wall takes the form of a hemisphere with a maximum radius of 3 ft. + 1 ft./level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form but does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

- **Material Component:** A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.
