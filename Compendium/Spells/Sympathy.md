## Sympathy

Object or location attracts certain creatures.

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]  
- **Level:** Drd 9, Sor/Wiz 8  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** One location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object  
- **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

You cause a **location or object** to emit magical vibrations that irresistibly draw **a specific kind of intelligent creature** or **a specific alignment**, defined precisely at casting. Creature subtypes or general descriptors are not allowed—specific species or alignment must be named.

Affected creatures feel **compelled** to stay near or possess the object, overwhelmed by emotional attachment. If a target saves successfully, it must save again after **1d6×10 minutes**; failure triggers the compulsion once more.
