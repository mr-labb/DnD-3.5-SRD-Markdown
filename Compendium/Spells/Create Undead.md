### Description

A more potent spell than [[animate dead]], this spell allows you to create stronger undead. The type of undead created depends on your caster level:

| **Caster Level**    | **Undead Created** |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 11th or lower       | Ghoul              |
| 12th–14th           | Ghast              |
| 15th–17th           | Mummy              |
| 18th or higher      | Mohrg              |

You may choose to create a less powerful undead than your level allows.

- Created undead are **not automatically controlled** by the caster.  
- If capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to **command the creature upon creation**.  
- **This spell must be cast at night.**

### Material Component

- A clay pot filled with **grave dirt**  
- A clay pot filled with **brackish water**  
- A **black onyx gem** worth at least **50 gp per HD** of the undead, placed into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse (consumed by the spell)
