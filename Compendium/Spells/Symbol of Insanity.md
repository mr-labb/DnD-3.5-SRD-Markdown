## Symbol of Insanity

Triggered rune renders nearby creatures insane.

This spell functions like [[Symbol of Death]], but instead of slaying, the **Symbol of Insanity** causes affected creatures within 60 ft. to become **permanently insane**, as per the *Insanity* spell.

Unlike the death variant, it has **no hit point cap**—once triggered, the symbol remains active for **10 minutes per caster level**, affecting any new targets entering its range.

- *Search and Disable Device DC:* 33 (25 + spell level) — only a rogue can attempt this  
- *[[Dispel Magic]]* can remove it  
- *[[Erase]]* has no effect  
- Destroying the surface **triggers** the symbol  

**Material Component:** Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth at least 5,000 gp.
