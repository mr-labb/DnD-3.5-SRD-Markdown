## Blasphemy

Kills, paralyzes, weakens, or dazes nonevil subjects.

*   Evocation [Evil, Sonic]
*   **Level:** Clr 7, Evil 7
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 40 ft.
*   **Effect:** Nonevil creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Any nonevil creature within the area of a *blasphemy* spell suffers the following cumulative and concurrent ill effects:

| HD Compared to Caster Level      | Effect(s)                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Equal to caster level            | Dazed                                     |
| Up to caster level –1            | Weakened, Dazed                           |
| Up to caster level –5            | Paralyzed, Weakened, Dazed                |
| Up to caster level –10           | Killed, Paralyzed, Weakened, Dazed        |

No saving throw is allowed against these effects:

- **Dazed:** Cannot take actions for 1 round; defends normally.  
- **Weakened:** Strength –2d6 for 2d4 rounds.  
- **Paralyzed:** Helpless for 1d10 minutes.  
- **Killed:** Living creatures die; undead are destroyed.

If you cast *blasphemy* on your home plane, nonevil extraplanar creatures within range are instantly **banished** for at least 24 hours. This banishment **does** allow a Will save at **–4 penalty** to resist.

Creatures with Hit Dice **higher than your caster level** are **unaffected**.
