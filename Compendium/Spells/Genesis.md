## Genesis

Creates a small demiplane.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9, Creation 9  
- **Components:** V, S, M, XP  
- **Casting Time:** 1 week (8 hours/day)  
- **Range:** 180 ft. (see text)  
- **Effect:** A demiplane coterminous with the Ethereal Plane, centered on your location  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

### Description

The spellcaster creates a finite plane with limited access—a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this spell are very small and minor in scope.

This spell can only be cast while on the **Ethereal Plane**. Upon casting, a local density fluctuation initiates the formation of a demiplane.  
- **Growth rate:** 1 foot in radius per day  
- **Maximum initial radius:** 180 feet  
- Substance is drawn from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter

The spellcaster determines the demiplane’s **environmental characteristics** upon first casting:
- Atmosphere  
- Water presence  
- Temperature  
- Terrain shape  

This spell **cannot create life** (including vegetation) or **constructs** (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, etc.). These must be added by other means.

Once the demiplane reaches its initial maximum size, further castings of *Genesis* can **expand the radius** by an additional **180 feet per casting**.

### Material Component

- A **crystalline sphere**

### XP Cost

- **5,000 XP**
