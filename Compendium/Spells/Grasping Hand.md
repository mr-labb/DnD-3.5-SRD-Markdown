#### Grapple Mechanics

- **Attack Bonus to Make Contact:**

The hand **holds** but does **not harm** creatures it grapples.

- **Bull rush** an opponent like [[Forceful Hand]]  
  - Strength check bonus: **+16**  
    - +10 for Strength 35  
    - +4 for being Large  
    - +2 for charging (always applies)
