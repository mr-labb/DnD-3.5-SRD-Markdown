This spell functions like [[Interposing Hand]], except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round.

Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for wizards, clerics, and sorcerers, respectively), +10 for the hand's Strength score (31), -1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of -1. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The grasping hand can also bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself as interposing hand does.

Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.

Arcane Focus: A leather glove.
