### Description

*Levitate* allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish.  
- A creature must be willing to be *levitated*, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature.  
- You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down up to 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action.  
- You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

A *levitating* creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon becomes increasingly unstable:  
- First attack: –1 penalty  
- Second: –2 penalty  
- Up to –5 maximum  
- A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.

### Focus

Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.
