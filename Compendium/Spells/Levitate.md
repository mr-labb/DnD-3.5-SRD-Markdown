<p><i>Levitate</i> allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be <i>levitated,</i> and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).</p><p>A <i>levitating</i> creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end.</p>
