## Warp Wood

Bends wood (shaft, handle, door, plank).

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Drd 2
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

<p>You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p><p>You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.</p><p>Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. <i>Make whole</i>, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.</p><p>You can combine multiple consecutive <i>warp wood</i> spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell.</p><p>Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.</p>
