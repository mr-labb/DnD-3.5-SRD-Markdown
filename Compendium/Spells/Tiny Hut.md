## Tiny Hut

Creates shelter for ten creatures.

- **School:** Evocation [Force]  
- **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** 20 ft.  
- **Effect:** 20-ft.-radius sphere centered on your location  
- **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.

The temperature inside the hut is 70°F if the exterior temperature is between 0°F and 100°F. An exterior temperature below 0°F or above 100°F adjusts the interior temperature at a 1-degree-for-1-degree rate. The hut provides protection against the elements, including rain, dust, and sandstorms. It withstands any wind less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or stronger destroys it.

The interior is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly or extinguish the light by command. The force field is opaque from the outside, but transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through it. However, occupants cannot be seen from outside (total concealment).

**Material Component:** A small crystal bead that shatters when the spell duration expires or the hut is dispelled.
