<p>You don't so much cast a <i>miracle</i> as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.</p><p>A <i>miracle</i> can do any of the following things.</p><list> <li>Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains).</li> <li>Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.</li> <li>Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <i>feeblemind</i> or <i>insanity</i>.</li> <li>Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li> </list><p>If the <i>miracle</i> has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost.</p><p>Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <i>miracle</i> costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <i>miracles</i> of this sort could include the following.</p><list> <li>Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</li> <li>Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.</li> <li>Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li> </list><p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <i>miracle</i> duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a <i>miracle</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.</p><p><i>XP Cost:</i> 5,000 XP (for some uses of the <i>miracle</i> spell; see above).</p>
