## Miracle

Requests a deity's intercession.

### Spell Details

- **School**: Evocation  
- **Level**: Clr 9, Luck 9  
- **Components**: V, S, XP; see text  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: See text  
- **Effect**: See text  
- **Duration**: See text  
- **Saving Throw**: See text  
- **Spell Resistance**: Yes  

### Description

You don’t so much cast *Miracle* as **petition your deity** to intercede directly. You describe your desired result and request divine intervention.

The following effects **do not require XP cost**:
- Duplicate any **cleric spell of 8th level or lower** (including domain spells)  
- Duplicate any **other spell of 7th level or lower**  
- Undo harmful effects of spells such as [[Feeblemind]] or [[Insanity]]  
- Create any effect of **similar power level**

Alternatively, more **powerful requests** may be granted, which **do require XP cost** (5,000 XP):

Examples include:
- Raising fallen allies mid-battle  
- Transporting you and allies (with gear) **across planes** to a specific location **without error**  
- Protecting an entire **city from natural disaster**

Requests inconsistent with the deity’s **nature or alignment** are automatically **refused**.

### Spell Duplication Notes

- Duplicated spells **allow saves and spell resistance** as normal  
- Save DCs are as for a **9th-level spell**  
- If duplicating a spell with an **XP cost**, you must pay that cost  
- If duplicating a spell with a **material component over 100 gp**, you must provide it

### XP Cost

5,000 XP (for powerful uses; see above)
