## Description

A twisting pattern of discordant, coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within it. The spell affects a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its Hit Dice:

- **6 or less**: Unconscious for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then [[Confused]] for 1d4 rounds. (Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.)  
- **7 to 12**: Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then [[Confused]] for 1d4 rounds.  
- **13 or more**: [[Confused]] for 1d4 rounds.  

Sightless creatures are not affected by Scintillating Pattern.

**Material Component**: A small crystal prism.
