<p>This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. <i>Break enchantment</i> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.</p><p>If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>break enchantment</i> works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.</p><p>If the effect comes from some permanent magic item <i>break enchantment</i> does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.</p>
