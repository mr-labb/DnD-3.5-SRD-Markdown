## Break Enchantment

Frees subjects from enchantments, alterations, curses, and petrification.

- Abjuration
- **Level:** Brd 4, Clr 5, Luck 5, Pal 4, Sor/Wiz 5
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** Up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** See text

This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. _Break enchantment_ can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by _dispel magic_, _break enchantment_ works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.

If the effect comes from some permanent magic item _break enchantment_ does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.
