This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members spring forth from the ground, floor, or any surface — even water — to grasp and crush creatures within the area.

Each creature in the zone must make a grapple check against the tentacles (treated as a Large creature with base attack bonus equal to your caster level and Strength 19, for a total grapple modifier of caster level +8). Tentacles are immune to all damage types.

Once a creature is grappled, the tentacles make another grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 bludgeoning damage. This continues until the spell ends or the creature escapes.

Any creature entering the area is immediately attacked. Non-grappled creatures move through the zone at half speed.

*Material Component:* A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid.
