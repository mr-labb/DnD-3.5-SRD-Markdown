### Description

This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The *Phase Door* is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the *Phase Door* and appear when you exit. If desired, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door.  

The door blocks light, sound, and spell effects and is opaque until used. Thus, it can serve as an escape route, although certain creatures—such as [[Phase Spider]]—can follow. A Gem of [[True Seeing]] or similar magic reveals its presence but doesn't grant access.

A *Phase Door* is subject to [[Dispel Magic]]. Anyone inside the passage when dispelled is harmlessly ejected as with a [[Passwall]] effect.

You can allow others to use the *Phase Door* by setting a triggering condition. These may be simple or elaborate, based on name, identity, or alignment—however, they must rely on observable actions or qualities (not level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points).

*Phase Door* may be made permanent using the [[Permanency]] spell.
