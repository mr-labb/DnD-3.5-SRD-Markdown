## Slow

One subject/level takes only one action/round, -1 to AC, reflex saves, and attack rolls.

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A *slowed* creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.

A *slowed* creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple *slow* effects don't stack. *Slow* counters and dispels *[[Haste]]*.

**Material Component:** A drop of molasses.
