## Detect Good

Reveals creatures, spells, or objects with Good alignment.

### Spell Details

- **Level:** Clr 1  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** 60 ft.  
- **Effect:** Cone-shaped emanation  
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

### Description

This spell functions like [[Detect Evil]], except that it reveals the auras of:

- Good-aligned creatures  
- Clerics or paladins of good deities  
- Good-aligned spells  
- Good magic items  

If you are of evil alignment, you may be vulnerable to an **overwhelming good aura**.

Note: Healing potions, antidotes, and similar beneficial items are **not inherently good** and are not detected by this spell.

You sense the presence of good. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

- **1st Round:** Presence or absence of good  
- **2nd Round:** Number of good auras (creatures, objects, spells) and the strength of the most potent aura  
- **3rd Round:** Power and location of each aura (direction only if out of line of sight)

If you are of good alignment and detect an overwhelming aura from a source with at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
