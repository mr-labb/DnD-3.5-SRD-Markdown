<p>A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a <i>dimensional anchor</i> include <i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,</i> and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a <i>gate</i> or <i>teleportation circle</i> for the duration of the spell.</p><p>A <i>dimensional anchor</i> does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, <i>dimensional anchor</i> does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.</p>
