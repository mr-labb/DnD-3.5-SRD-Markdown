### Description

You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The *runes* detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the *runes* (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the *runes* is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the *runes* were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the *runes.* Likewise, you can remove the *runes* whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful [[Dispel Magic]] or [[Erase]] spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the *runes* and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

**Note:** Magic traps such as *explosive runes* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the *runes* and Disable Device to thwart them. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for *explosive runes*.
