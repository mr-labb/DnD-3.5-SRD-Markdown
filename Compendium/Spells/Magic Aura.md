## Magic Aura

Alters object's magic aura.

### Spell Details

- **School**: Illusion (Glamer)  
- **Level**: Brd 1, Magic 1, Sor/Wiz 1  
- **Components**: V, S, F  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Touch  
- **Effect**: One touched object weighing up to 5 lb./level  
- **Duration**: One day/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw**: None; see text  
- **Spell Resistance**: No  

### Description

You alter an item's aura so that it registers to [[Detect]] spells (and similar effects) as:

- Nonmagical  
- A magic item of a kind you specify  
- The subject of a spell you specify

If the object bearing *Magic Aura* is examined with [[Identify]] or similar magic:
- The examiner may recognize the false aura and detect true properties with a **successful Will save**  
- On a failed save, the false aura remains convincing and cannot be uncovered by any test

**Limitations**:
- Does **not** function on items with exceptionally powerful auras (e.g., artifacts)  
- A magic weapon, shield, or armor must be **masterwork** quality; mundane items with a magical aura appear suspicious

### Focus

A small square of silk passed over the object receiving the aura.
