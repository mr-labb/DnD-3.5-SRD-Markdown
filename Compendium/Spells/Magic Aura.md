<p>You alter an item's aura so that it registers to <i>detect</i> spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.</p><p>If the object bearing <i>magic aura</i> has <i>identify</i> cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.</p><p>If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), <i>magic aura</i> doesn't work.</p><p><i>Note:</i> A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura.</p>
