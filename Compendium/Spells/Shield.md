<p><i>Shield</i> creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. It negates <i>magic missile</i> attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The <i>shield</i> has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. Unlike with a normal tower shield, you can't use the <i>shield</i> spell for cover.</p>
