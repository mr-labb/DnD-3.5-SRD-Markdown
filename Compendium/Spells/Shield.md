## Description

*Shield* creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. It negates *[[magic missile]]* attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The *shield* has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. Unlike with a normal tower shield, you can't use the *shield* spell for cover.
