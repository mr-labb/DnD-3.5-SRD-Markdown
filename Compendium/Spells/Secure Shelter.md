## Description

You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.

The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling provides considerable security — it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. It resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not those cast by siege engines or giants).

The door, shutters, and chimney are secure against intrusion. The door and shutters are [[Arcane Lock|[Arcane Locked]], and the chimney is secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. These three areas are also protected by an [[Alarm]] spell. An [[Unseen Servant]] is conjured to serve you for the shelter’s duration.

The [[Secure Shelter]] contains basic furnishings: eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.

**Material Component**: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the [[Unseen Servant]] spell (string and a bit of wood) if that benefit is to be included.

**Focus**: The focus of the [[Alarm]] spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if that benefit is to be included.
