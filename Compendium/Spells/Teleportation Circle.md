## Teleportation Circle

Circle teleports any creature inside to designated spot.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9  
- **Components:** V, M  
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
- **Range:** 0 ft.  
- **Effect:** 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it  
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as [[Teleport Greater|Greater Teleport]], any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you cannot change it.

The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to [[teleport]] creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.

The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to prevent accidental activation, you should visibly mark the circle.

[[Teleportation Circle]] can be made permanent with [[Permanency]]. A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

**Note:** Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable.  
- Only a rogue can use the **Search** and **Disable Device** skills.  
- **DC:** 25 + spell level = 34

**Material Component:** Amber dust to cover the area of the circle (cost 1,000 gp)
