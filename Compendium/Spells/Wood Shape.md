## Wood Shape

Rearranges wooden objects to suit you.

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Drd 2  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** One touched piece of wood no larger than 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)  

*Wood shape* enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.
