## Vision

As Legend Lore, but quicker and strenuous.

- **School:** Divination  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7  
- **Components:** V, S, M, XP  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal  
- **Effect:** You  
- **Duration:** See text  
- **Saving Throw:** —  
- **Spell Resistance:** —  

This spell functions similarly to *[[Legend Lore]]*, but is faster to cast and more taxing on the caster. After posing a question about a person, place, or object, you cast *Vision* and attempt a **caster level check** to receive a mystical insight.

- **DC 20:** If the subject is present, you receive a clear vision.
- **DC 25:** If only detailed information is known, the vision is incomplete.
- **DC 30:** If only rumors are known, the vision is vague and cryptic.

This spell bypasses lengthy rituals and days of casting time, but requires effort and risk.

- **XP Cost:** 100 XP
