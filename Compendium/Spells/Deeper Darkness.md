## Deeper Darkness

Object sheds supernatural shadow in 60-ft. radius.

*   Evocation [Darkness]
*   **Level:** Clr 3
*   **Components:** V, M/DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Effect:** Object touched
*   **Duration:** One day/level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell functions like [[darkness]], except that the object radiates shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius and the darkness lasts longer.

Daylight brought into an area of deeper darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

Deeper darkness counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, including [[daylight]] and [[light]].
