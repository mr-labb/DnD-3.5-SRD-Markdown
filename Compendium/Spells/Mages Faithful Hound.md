### Description

You conjure a phantom watchdog that is **invisible to everyone but you** and **guards the area where it was conjured** (it cannot move).

- Begins barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within **30 feet**  
  - Creatures present when conjured may move freely until they **leave and return**, which triggers barking  
- Sees **invisible and ethereal creatures**, ignores **figments**, but reacts to **shadow illusions**  
- If a creature approaches within **5 feet**, the hound stops barking and bites:  
  - **+10 attack bonus**, **2d6+3 piercing damage**, once per round  
  - Treated as **invisible**, and its bite counts as a **magic weapon** for overcoming damage reduction

- It **cannot be attacked**, but can be **dispelled**  
- Duration is **1 hour per caster level** until barking begins, then **1 round per caster level**  
- If you move **more than 100 feet away**, the spell ends
