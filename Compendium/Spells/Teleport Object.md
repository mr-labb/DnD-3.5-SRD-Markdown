## Teleport Object

As Teleport, but affects a touched object.

*   Conjuration (Teleportation)
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Effect:** One touched object of up to 50 lb./level and 3 cu. ft./level
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

This spell functions like <i>[[teleport]],</i> except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted <i>[[dispel magic]]</i> spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
