## Teleport Object

As [[Teleport]], but affects a touched object.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** One touched object of up to 50 lb./level and 3 cu. ft./level  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)  

This spell functions like [[Teleport]], except that it teleports an object rather than yourself. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the **Ethereal Plane**. The point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted [[Dispel Magic]] cast on that point returns the item from the Ethereal Plane.
