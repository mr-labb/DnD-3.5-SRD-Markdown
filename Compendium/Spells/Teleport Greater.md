## Teleport, Greater

As [[Teleport]], but no range limit and no off-target arrival.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7, Travel 7  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal and touch  
- **Effect:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object)  

This spell functions like [[Teleport]], except that there is **no range limit** and **no chance of arriving off target**. Additionally, you **do not need to have seen the destination**, but you must have at least a **reliable description** of the place you wish to reach.

If the description is insufficient or misleading, the spell fails â€” you **disappear and reappear in your original location**. **Interplanar travel is not possible**.
