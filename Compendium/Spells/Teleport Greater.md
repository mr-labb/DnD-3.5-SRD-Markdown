As Teleport, but no range limit and no off-target arrival.

*   Conjuration (Teleportation)
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7, Travel 7

*   **Range:** Personal and touch
*   **Effect:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures

This spell functions like <i>[[teleport]],</i> except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.
