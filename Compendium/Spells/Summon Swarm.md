You summon a swarm of creatures—choose either bats, rats, or spiders—which immediately fills the designated area and attacks all other living creatures within it. You may even summon the swarm directly into an area already occupied by other beings. Once summoned, the swarm acts independently, pursuing the nearest living target if none are initially in range. The caster cannot direct or control its movements or choice of target.
