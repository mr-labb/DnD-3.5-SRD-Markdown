Depending on the version chosen, *Control Water* either raises or lowers water:

### Lower Water

- Reduces depth by **2 ft. per caster level** (minimum **1 inch** depth)
- Forms a **square depression**, each side up to **10 ft. × caster level**
- In deep bodies of water (e.g. oceans), creates a **whirlpool** that:
  - **Traps ships**, disabling normal movement
  - **Acts as a *Slow* spell** when used on water elementals or water-based creatures (Will negates)
  - Has **no effect on other creature types**

### Raise Water

- Increases depth similarly to *Lower Water*
- **Boats are lifted**, then slide down the water hump
- **Water can overflow** onto dry land (beaches, riverbanks, etc.)

You may **reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other**, customizing the affected area.

**Arcane Material Component:**  
- A **drop of water** (for *Raise Water*) or a **pinch of dust** (for *Lower Water*)
