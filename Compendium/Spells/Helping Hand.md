## Helping Hand

Ghostly hand leads subject to you.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Evocation  
- **Level:** Clr 3  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** 5 miles  
- **Effect:** Ghostly hand  
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

### Description

You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.

When cast, the hand appears before you. You specify a creature by **physical description**, such as race, gender, and appearance. Ambiguous criteria such as class, level, or alignment cannot be used. The hand then searches for a subject matching the description.

#### Time to Locate by Distance:

| **Distance**     | **Time to Locate** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 100 ft. or less  | 1 round            |
| 1,000 ft.        | 1 minute           |
| 1 mile           | 10 minutes         |
| 2 miles          | 1 hour             |
| 3 miles          | 2 hours            |
| 4 miles          | 3 hours            |
| 5 miles          | 4 hours            |

Once the hand finds the subject, it beckons them forward and leads them to you by hovering 10 ft. ahead at up to **240 ft./round**. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues beckoning until the spell ends. If the spell expires while the subject is en route, the hand vanishes and the subject must find their own way.

If multiple subjects within range match the description, the hand chooses the **closest**. If refused, it will not search again. If none match the description within 5 miles after 4 hours, the hand returns, displays an **open palm**, and disappears.

The hand is **invisible** to all but you and the designated subject. It has no physical form, cannot perform tasks or engage in combat, and cannot travel beyond its 5-mile range. It can ooze through small cracks but cannot pass through solid objects.
