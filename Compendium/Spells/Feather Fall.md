## Feather Fall

Objects or creatures fall slowly.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 free action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart  
- **Duration:** Until landing or 1 round/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)  

### Description

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather Fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to **60 feet per round** (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take **no damage** upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures:  
- A Large creature or object counts as **two** Medium creatures or objects  
- A Huge creature or object counts as **two** Large creatures or objects, and so forth

You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a **free action**, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell **when it isn't your turn**.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does **half normal damage** based on its weight, with **no bonus** for the height of the drop.

Feather Fall works **only upon free-falling objects**. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.
