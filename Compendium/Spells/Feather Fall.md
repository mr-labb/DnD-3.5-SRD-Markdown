## Feather Fall

Objects or creatures fall slowly.

*   Transmutation
*   **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 free action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart
*   **Duration:** Until landing or 1 round/level
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

<p>The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. <i>Feather fall</i> instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.</p><p>The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.</p><p>You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.</p><p>This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.</p><p><i>Feather fall</i> works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.</p>
