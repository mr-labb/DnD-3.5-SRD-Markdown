<p>You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.</p><p>The <i>nightmare</i> prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The <i>nightmare</i> leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.</p><p>The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.</p><table> <tr decoration="underline"> <td colspan="2"> <b>Knowledge</b> </td> <td> <b>Will Save Modifier</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> None* </td> <td> +10 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) </td> <td> +5 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Firsthand (you have met the subject) </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Familiar (you know the subject well) </td> <td> -5 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> * You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of. </td> </tr> </table><table> <tr decoration="underline"> <td colspan="2"> <b>Connection</b> </td> <td> <b>Will Save Modifier</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Likeness or picture </td> <td> -2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Possession or garment </td> <td> -4 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. </td> <td> -10 </td> </tr> </table><p><i>Dispel evil</i> cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the <i>nightmare</i> and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the <i>dispel evil</i>.</p><p>If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting.
