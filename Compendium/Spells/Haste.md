## Haste

One creature/level moves faster, +1 on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

- **Duration:** 1 round/level

### Description

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects:

- When making a **full attack action**, a hasted creature may make **one extra attack** with any weapon it is holding.  
  - The attack is made using the creature's **full base attack bonus**, plus applicable modifiers  
  - This effect is **not cumulative** with similar effects (e.g., weapon of speed)  
  - Does **not grant an extra action**, so it cannot be used to cast a second spell or take another action

- A hasted creature gains:  
  - **+1 bonus on attack rolls**  
  - **+1 dodge bonus to AC**  
  - **+1 bonus on Reflex saves**  
  - Dodge bonuses are lost if Dexterity bonus to AC is lost

- All movement modes (land, burrow, climb, fly, swim) are increased by **30 feet**, to a maximum of **twice normal speed** for that mode  
  - This increase counts as an **enhancement bonus**  
  - Affects **jumping distance** as per increased speed

- Multiple [[Haste]] effects **do not stack**  
- [[Haste]] **dispels and counters** [[Slow]]

### Material Component

- A shaving of **licorice root**
