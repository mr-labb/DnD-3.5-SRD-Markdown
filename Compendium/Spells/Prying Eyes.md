## Description

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called "eyes") equal to **1d4 + your caster level**. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see **120 feet** (normal vision only) in all directions.

Each eye is:
- A **Fine construct** about the size of a small apple  
- Has **1 hit point**, **AC 18** (+8 size bonus)  
- Flies at **30 ft. speed** with **perfect maneuverability**  
- Possesses **+16 Hide** and **Spot = caster level (max +15)**  
- Affected by visual limitations such as darkness, fog, or illusions  
- Must navigate darkness by **touch**

When created, you assign a **command (max 25 words)**. The eyes possess all your knowledge.

To report findings, eyes must **return to your hand**, and then each replays all it has seen during its existence. Replay speed is **1 round per hour** of recorded images. Eyes **disappear after reporting**.

Limitations:
- Eyes that exceed **1 mile range** instantly vanish  
- You **do not know** whether they were destroyed or out of range  
- Exist for **1 hour/level** or until they return  
- Eyes can be **destroyed by [[dispel magic]]**  
- Darkness or collisions may also destroy an eye

**Material Component**: A handful of crystal marbles.
