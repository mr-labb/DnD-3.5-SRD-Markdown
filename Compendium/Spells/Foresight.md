### Description

This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once Foresight is cast, you receive **instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm** to the subject. You are never **surprised** or **[[flat-footed]]**.

In addition, you gain a **+2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves**. This bonus is lost whenever you would lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.

When another creature is the subject, you receive warnings about that creature. You must **communicate** those warnings for them to be useful. The subject may be caught unprepared if they donâ€™t receive timely warning.

Communication can include:
- Shouting
- Physically pulling them out of danger
- Telepathic communication (via an appropriate spell)

However, the subject does **not gain the insight bonus** to AC and Reflex saves.
