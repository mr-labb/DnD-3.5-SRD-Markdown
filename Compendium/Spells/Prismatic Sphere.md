## Description

This spell functions like [[Prismatic Wall]], except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.

- The sphere’s blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts **2d4×10 minutes**.  
- You can pass into and out of the prismatic sphere and remain near it without harm.  
- While inside, the sphere **blocks all projections**, including spells.  
- Other creatures that attack you or attempt to pass through suffer the effects of **each color**, one at a time.  

Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, and the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface.

The colors of the sphere have the same effects as those of [[Prismatic Wall]].

*Prismatic Sphere* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency]]* spell.
