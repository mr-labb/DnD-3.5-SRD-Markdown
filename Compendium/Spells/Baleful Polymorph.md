You change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD (such as a dog, [[lizard]], [[monkey]], or [[toad]]). The subject takes on all the statistics and special abilities of an average member of the new form in place of its own, except:

- The target retains its own alignment (and personality, within the limits of the new form's ability scores).
- The target retains its own hit points.
- The target is treated as having its normal Hit Dice for effects based on HD (e.g., *sleep*), though it uses the new form's base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and all other statistics derived from Hit Dice.
- The target retains the ability to understand (but not to speak) any languages it knew in its original form. It can write if the new form permits (e.g., drawing in dirt with a paw).

With those exceptions, all other game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all special abilities, including class features.

All items worn or carried fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.

If the new form would be fatal to the creature (e.g., a fish on land or a [[toad]] in midair), the subject gains a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save.

If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must make a Will save. Failure causes it to lose all memories and language comprehension from its previous form, and its HD and hit points change to match the new form. These effects are reversed if the spell ends.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune. Creatures with the shapechanger subtype (e.g., lycanthropes, doppelgangers) can revert to their natural form as a standard action, which ends the spell.
