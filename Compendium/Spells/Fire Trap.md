### Description

Fire Trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A Fire Trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed.

When casting Fire Trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal **1d4 points of fire damage +1 per caster level** (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is **not harmed** by this explosion.

A fire trapped item **cannot have a second closure or warding spell** placed on it.

A [[Knock]] spell does **not bypass** a Fire Trap. An unsuccessful [[Dispel Magic]] spell does **not detonate** the trap.

Underwater, this ward deals **half damage** and creates a large cloud of steam.

You can use the fire trapped object **without discharging** it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically **attuned** when cast. Attuning usually involves setting a **password** that you can share with friends.

**Note:** Magic traps such as Fire Trap are **hard to detect and disable**. A rogue (only) can use the **Search** skill to find a Fire Trap and **Disable Device** to thwart it.  
- DC is **25 + spell level**:  
  - DC **27** for a druid's Fire Trap  
  - DC **29** for the arcane version  

### Material Component

- **Half-pound of gold dust** (cost 25 gp), sprinkled on the warded object.
