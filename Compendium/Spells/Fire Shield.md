<p>This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).</p><p>Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the <i>shield</i> protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the <i>shield</i> protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.</p><p>When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color) - blue or green if the <i>chill shield</i> is cast, violet or blue if the <i>warm shield</i> is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.</p><p><i>Warm Shield:</i> The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.</p><p><i>Chill Shield:</i> The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A bit of phosphorus for the <i>warm shield;</i> a live firefly or glowworm or the tail portions of four dead ones for the <i>chill shield</i>.</p>
