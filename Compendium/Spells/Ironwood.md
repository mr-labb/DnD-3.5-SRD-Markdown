### Description

*Ironwood* is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in nearly every way, *ironwood* is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel.

- Spells that affect metal or iron do **not** function on *ironwood*  
- Spells that affect wood **do** work on it, but *ironwood* does **not** burn  
- You may use this spell with [[Wood Shape]] or wood-related Craft checks to fashion items functioning like steel  
- Examples include wooden plate armor and swords that are as durable as steel counterparts  
- These items are freely usable by druids

If you create **only half** as much *ironwood* as allowed, the crafted weapon, shield, or armor is treated as a **magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus**

### Material Component

Wood shaped into the form of the intended *ironwood* object.
