## Magic Circle against Evil

As [[Protection from Evil]], but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.

### Spell Details

- **School**: Abjuration [Good]  
- **Level**: Clr 3, Good 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3  
- **Components**: V, S, M/DF  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Touch  
- **Effect**: 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature  
- **Duration**: 10 min./level  
- **Saving Throw**: Will negates (harmless)  
- **Spell Resistance**: No; see text  

### Description

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a [[Protection from Evil]] spell.  
- Nongood summoned creatures **cannot enter the area**  
- To keep a creature at bay, you must **overcome its spell resistance**  
- Deflection and resistance bonuses and protection from mental control **apply regardless** of spell resistance

This spell can be **focused inward** to **bind a nongood called creature** (e.g., summoned with [[Planar Binding Lesser|Lesser Planar Binding]], [[Planar Binding]], [[Planar Binding Greater|Greater Planar Binding]])  
- Must cast calling spell within 1 round of casting *Magic Circle*  
- The creature **cannot cross the circleâ€™s boundary**  
- If too large, the spell acts as normal [[Protection from Evil]] only for that creature

**Circle mechanics**:
- If the **powdered silver circle is broken**, the effect **immediately ends**  
- The **trapped creature** cannot disturb the circle directly or indirectly  
- **Other creatures** can break the circle  
- If the called creature has **spell resistance**, it may test once per day  
  - Failure to overcome breaks the circle  
- Creature with **dimensional travel** (e.g., [[Astral Projection]], [[Blink]], [[Teleport]], etc.) can escape  
  - To prevent, cast [[Dimensional Anchor]] on the creature **before it acts**  
  - Anchor lasts as long as the *Magic Circle*  
- Ranged attacks may cross the circle, but not affect the circle itself

**Diagram enhancement**:
- A **secure diagram** can reinforce the magic circle  
- Drawn by hand in 10 minutes with a **DC 20 Spellcraft** check  
- Can take 10 or 20, if time permits  
- Allows casting of [[Dimensional Anchor]] the round before summoning  
- Creatures **cannot use spell resistance**, nor cross the diagram with abilities or attacks  
- If a creature attempts a **Charisma check** to escape (per [[Planar Binding Lesser|Lesser Planar Binding]]), DC increases by 5  
- **Any disturbance** to the diagram **releases the creature immediately**

*Magic Circle against Evil* is **not cumulative** with [[Protection from Evil]]

### Arcane Material Component

A little powdered silver used to trace a 3-foot-diameter circle around the warded creature.
