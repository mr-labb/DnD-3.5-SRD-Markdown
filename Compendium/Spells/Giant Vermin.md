### Description

You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted per casting, and all targets must be grown to the same size.

The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your caster level:

| **Caster Level** | **Vermin Size** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 9th or lower     | Medium          |
| 10th–13th        | Large           |
| 14th–17th        | Huge            |
| 18th–19th        | Gargantuan      |
| 20th or higher   | Colossal        |

Giant vermin created by this spell do not harm you. You can command them with simple instructions such as "Attack," "Defend," or "Stop." Complex tasks like "guard against this type of enemy" are beyond their understanding. If left uncommanded, the vermin will attack nearby creatures indiscriminately.
