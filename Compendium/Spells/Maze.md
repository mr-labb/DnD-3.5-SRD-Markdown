<p>You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.</p><p>On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the <i>maze</i> spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as <i>teleport</i> and <i>dimension door,</i> do not help a creature escape a <i>maze</i> spell, although a <i>plane shift</i> spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.</p>
