## Sleet Storm

Hampers vision and movement.

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]  
- **Level:** Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 3  
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).

The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

**Arcane Material Component:** A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.
