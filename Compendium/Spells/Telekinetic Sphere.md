## Telekinetic Sphere

As [[Resilient Sphere]], but you move sphere telekinetically.

- **School:** Evocation [Force]  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or objects  
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)  

This spell functions like [[Resilient Sphere]], with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe become nearly weightless. Anything contained within a **telekinetic sphere** weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight.

You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs **5,000 pounds or less**. Telekinetic control extends out to **medium range** (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) after the sphere encapsulates its contents.

- Begin moving the sphere in the round after casting  
- With concentration (standard action), move it up to **30 ft./round**  
- If concentration ceases:  
  - It remains stationary (on a flat surface)  
  - It descends slowly (60 ft./round) if aloft  
  - It resumes movement if concentration resumes later  
- The slow descent **does not cause damage** to contents  
- You **can move the sphere telekinetically even from inside it**

**Material Component:**  
- A hemispherical piece of clear crystal  
- A matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic  
- A pair of small bar magnets
