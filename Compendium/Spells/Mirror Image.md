### Description

Several illusory duplicates of you appear, making it difficult for enemies to identify the true target. The figments stay close to you and vanish when struck.

- *Mirror Image* creates **1d4 images +1 per three caster levels** (maximum **8 images**)  
- Figments remain clustered: each within **5 feet** of another figment or you  
- You may move **into and through** figments  
- Observers **cannot distinguish** you from the figments using vision or hearing  
- Figments mimic your actions (e.g., casting, drinking potions, levitating)  
- Figments may move through each other

**Targeting Mechanics**:
- Enemies must choose randomly among indistinguishable targets  
- A **successful attack** against an image **destroys it**  
- An image's **AC** is: **10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier**  
- Figments **react normally** to area spells (e.g., appear damaged by [[Fireball]])

**Additional Notes**:
- You may merge with or separate from figments to confuse observers  
- An attacker must **see the images** to be fooled  
- If you are **invisible** or the attacker **can't see**, the spell has **no effect**
