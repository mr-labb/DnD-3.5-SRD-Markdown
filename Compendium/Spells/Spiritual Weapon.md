## Spiritual Weapon

Magic weapon attacks on its own.

- **School:** Evocation [Force]  
- **Level:** Clr 2, War 2  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect:** Magic weapon of force  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level).

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or one with spiritual significance. It has the same threat range and critical multipliers as the real weapon it replicates. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon—able to bypass damage reduction and hit incorporeal creatures without miss chance. It always strikes from your direction, without benefiting from flanking or being influenced by your feats or combat actions.

Each round, you may use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If not redirected, it continues to attack the previous round’s target. Attacks use your base attack bonus + Wisdom modifier, and gain multiple attacks per round if your BAB permits. Even if the form is a ranged weapon, it uses the spell’s range and cannot perform ranged attacks beyond that.

If the weapon goes beyond the spell’s range, out of sight, or is not being directed, it returns to you and hovers.

A Spiritual Weapon cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but can be affected by [[Dispel Magic]], [[Disintegrate]], Sphere of Annihilation, or Rod of Cancellation. Its AC against touch attacks is 12.

If the target has spell resistance, make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). On a failure, the spell is dispelled. On success, the weapon continues to function against the creature for the spell’s duration.

The weapon you get depends on your deity or alignment:

- **Chaos:** Battleaxe  
- **Evil:** Light flail  
- **Good:** Warhammer  
- **Law:** Longsword  

A cleric without a deity selects based on alignment. Neutral clerics may choose any alignment weapon if acting accordingly.
