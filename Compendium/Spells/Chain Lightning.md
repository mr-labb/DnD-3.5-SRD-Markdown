This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke from your fingertips. Unlike *[[lightning bolt]]*, *chain lightning* strikes one initial target and then arcs to secondary targets.

- Primary target takes **1d6 electricity damage per caster level** (max **20d6**).
- You may select up to **one secondary target per caster level** (max **20**) within **30 ft.** of the primary target.
- Each secondary target takes **half the damage** dealt to the primary target (rounded down).
- Reflex save halves the damage for all targets.
- No target may be struck more than once, and you may choose fewer than the maximum number of secondary targets.

**Focus:** A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod; plus one silver pin per caster level.
