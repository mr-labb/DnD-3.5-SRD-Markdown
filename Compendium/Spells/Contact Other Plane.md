## Contact Other Plane

Lets you ask questions of extraplanar entity.

* **School:** Divination  
* **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5  
* **Components:** V  
* **Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
* **Range:** Personal  
* **Effect:** You  
* **Duration:** Concentration  
* **Saving Throw:** Not specified  
* **Spell Resistance:** Not specified

You send your mind to another plane (Elemental or Outer) to consult with extraplanar powers. You may ask **one yes-or-no question per two caster levels**, answered during the same round. Entities respond in **one-word answers** like "yes," "no," or "irrelevant," but may also say "unclear" or lie, depending on the plane contacted.

- Powers are **not omniscient**, and their responses may reflect personal motives.
- Contacting distant planes increases the chance of **Intelligence/Charisma loss**, but also **improves chances of accurate answers**.

### Notes

- On failure to avoid mental strain, **Intelligence and Charisma drop to 8 for the duration**.
- If this occurs, the effect takes place immediately, and **no answer is received**.
- Contact may be **blocked by deific forces** or planar interference.
- Random results are influenced by **entity personalities** and can be misleading.
