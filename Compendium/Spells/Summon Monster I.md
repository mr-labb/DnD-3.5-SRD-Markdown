## Summon Monster I

Calls extraplanar creature to fight for you.

- **Components:** V, S, F/DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 round  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.

If you summon a creature with an elemental or alignment subtype (air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water), the spell is also treated as having that descriptor.

**Arcane Focus:** A tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle.
