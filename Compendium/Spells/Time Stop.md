## Time Stop

You act freely for 1d4+1 rounds.

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9, Trickery 9  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal  
- **Effect:** You  
- **Duration:** 1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text  
- **Saving Throw:** Not specified  
- **Spell Resistance:** Not specified  

This spell appears to stop time for everyone but you. In reality, you accelerate so much that other creatures seem frozen, though they continue to move at their normal speeds. You are free to act for **1d4+1 rounds of apparent time**.

- **Hazards:** You are still vulnerable to environmental damage (fire, cold, gas, etc.)
- **Limitations:**  
  - You **cannot target other creatures** with attacks or spells during this time  
  - **Area spells** that last longer than Time Stop affect creatures normally after Time Stop ends  
  - You **cannot move or affect items** held or worn by creatures  
  - You **can interact** with unattended objects  
  - You are **undetectable** while Time Stop is active  
  - You **cannot enter** areas protected by an [[Antimagic Field]]

Most casters use this time to **defend themselves**, **summon allies**, or **escape** combat.
