Subject gains 2d4 negative levels.

### Spell Details

- **Level:** Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9

- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

### Description

This spell functions like [[Enervation]], except that the creature struck gains **2d4 negative levels**, and the negative levels **last longer**.

There is **no saving throw** to avoid gaining the negative levels, but **24 hours** after gaining them, the subject must make a **Fortitude saving throw** (DC = *Energy Drain* spell's save DC) **for each negative level**:

- On **success**: the negative level is removed  
- On **failure**: the negative level goes away, but one of the subject's **character levels is permanently drained**

An **undead creature** struck by the ray gains **2d4 Ã— 5 temporary hit points** for **1 hour**.
