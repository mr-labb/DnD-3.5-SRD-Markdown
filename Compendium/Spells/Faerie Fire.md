Outlines subjects with light, canceling Blur, concealment, and the like.

- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action

- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

### Description

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical [[Darkness]] effect functions normally), [[Blur]], [[Displacement]], [[Invisibility]], or similar effects.

The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.

The [[Faerie Fire]] can be **blue**, **green**, or **violet**, according to your choice at the time of casting.

[[Faerie Fire]] does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
