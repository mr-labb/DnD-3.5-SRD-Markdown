Outlines subjects with light, canceling Blur, concealment, and the like.

*   Evocation [Light]
*   **Level:** Drd 1
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None

<p>A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical <i>darkness</i> effect functions normally), <i>blur</i>, <i>displacement</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The <i>faerie fire</i> can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The <i>faerie fire</i> does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.</p>
