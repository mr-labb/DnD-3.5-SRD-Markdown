### Description

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes too. If cast on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject unless you can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.

- Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible.  
- Items picked up disappear if tucked into clothing or pouches.  
- Light itself is never invisible, though its source may be, creating light with no visible origin.  
- Any part of an item carried by the subject that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

The subject is not magically silenced. Certain conditions may reveal their presence (e.g., stepping in a puddle).

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. An *attack* includes:
- Any spell that targets a foe or whose area/effect includes a foe.  
- Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell.  
- Indirect harm is not considered an attack (e.g. summoning monsters, triggering traps).  
- Spells that affect only allies (e.g. [[Bless]]) are not considered attacks even if foes are in the area.

*Invisibility* may be made permanent on objects only via [[Permanency]].

### Material Component

An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.
