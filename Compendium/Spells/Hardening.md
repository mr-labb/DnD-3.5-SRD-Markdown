## Hardening

Increases the hardness of materials.

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6, Artifice 7  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Target:** One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./level (see text)  
- **Duration:** Permanent  
- **Saving Throw:** None

This spell increases the hardness of materials. For every two caster levels, increase by 1 the hardness of the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the materialâ€™s resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement.

The *hardening* spell does not in any way affect resistance to other forms of transformation.

This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet per level of the spellcaster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level.
