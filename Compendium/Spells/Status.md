## Status

Monitors condition, position of allies.

- **School:** Divination  
- **Level:** Clr 2  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** One living creature touched per three levels  
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)  

When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, [[Status]] allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition.

You are aware of the direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, [[Confused]], or similar.

Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell, as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane or dies, the spell ceases to function for that target.
