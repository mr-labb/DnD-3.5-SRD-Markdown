## Transport via Plants

Move instantly from one plant to another of the same kind.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Drd 6  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Unlimited  
- **Effect:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures  
- **Duration:** 1 round  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

You can enter any normal living plant (Medium or larger) and travel instantly to another living plant of the same kind, regardless of the distance between them. 

- The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it must be alive.  
- If uncertain of a specific destination plant, you may designate direction and distanceâ€”the spell transports you as close as possible.  
- If the desired destination plant is dead, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.  
- The spell cannot be used to travel through **plant creatures**.

You may bring along:
- Objects up to your **maximum load**  
- One additional **Medium or smaller willing creature** per **three caster levels**, carrying gear up to its maximum load  
- Creature size conversions:  
  - Large = 2 Medium  
  - Huge = 2 Large  
  - All creatures must be in contact, and at least one must touch you

**Hazard:** If the occupied plant is destroyed, you and any companions are slain and ejected along with your possessions.
