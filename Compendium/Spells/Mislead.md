  - It **cannot attack** or **cast spells**, but may **pretend to do so**

**Duration**:
- The illusory double lasts while you **concentrate**, plus **3 additional rounds**  
- After concentration ends, the figment continues the last activity until the duration expires  
- [[Invisibility Greater|Greater Invisibility]] effect lasts for **1 round per level**, regardless of concentration
