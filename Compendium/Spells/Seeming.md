## Seeming

Changes appearance of one person per two levels.

- **School**: Illusion (Glamer)  
- **Level**: Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5  
- **Components**: V, S  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect**: One creature per two caster levels (max 30 ft. between any two)  
- **Duration**: 12 hours (D)  
- **Saving Throw**: Will negates or Will disbelief (on interaction)  
- **Spell Resistance**: Yes (if unwilling)  

## Description

This spell works similarly to [[Disguise Self]], but allows you to alter the appearance of other creatures, not just yourself. It can affect one creature per two caster levels, provided the targets stay within 30 feet of each other.

Details:
- The illusion is visual only; it cannot change voice, scent, or tactile traits.  
- Affected creatures revert to their true forms if slain.  
- Unwilling targets may resist via Will saving throws or spell resistance.  

Great for infiltration, roleplay intrigue, or confusing foes in social encounters!
