This spell functions like *[[Summon Natures Ally I|Summon Nature's Ally I]]*, except you may summon:
- One **3rd-level** creature from the list below  
- **1d3 2nd-level** creatures of the same kind  
- Or **1d4+1 1st-level** creatures of the same kind  

Summoned animals act immediately and instinctively. If you can communicate with them, you may direct specific actions. Summoning into incompatible environments is not allowed, and summoned creatures cannot summon or teleport.

Spells that summon creatures with air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water subtypes are also of that type.
