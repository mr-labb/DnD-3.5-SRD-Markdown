## Dream

Sends message to anyone sleeping.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]  
- **Level:** Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute  
- **Range:** Unlimited  
- **Effect:** One living creature touched  
- **Duration:** See text  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

### Description

You or a designated messenger sends a **phantasmal message** to a sleeping target in the form of a dream.

#### Mechanics

- You must **name or clearly identify** the recipient at the start  
- Messenger enters a **trance**, appears in the recipient’s dream, and delivers the message  
- **Any length** of message may be sent  
- Recipient **remembers it perfectly** upon waking  
- Communication is strictly **one-way**  
  - Recipient cannot reply  
  - Messenger gains no insight into the dream or thoughts of the target

#### Timing & Trance Behavior

- Spell duration = time needed to **enter and deliver** the message  
- If target is **awake**, messenger may:
  - End the spell immediately, or  
  - Remain in **trance** until the target sleeps  
- Disturbing the messenger during trance **ends the spell** prematurely  
- The messenger is **completely unaware and defenseless** during trance (automatically fails saving throws)

#### Limitations

- Targets must be capable of **sleep and dreaming**  
  - **Elves** (but not half-elves) typically **cannot be contacted** this way

Dream delivers critical messages across vast distances, untouched by wards or terrain—but the vulnerability of the messenger makes timing and security paramount.
