## Soul Bind

Traps newly dead soul to prevent Resurrection.

- **School:** Necromancy  
- **Level:** Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9  
- **Components:** V, S, F  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** Corpse  
- **Duration:** Permanent  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through *[[Clone]]*, *[[Raise Dead]]*, *Reincarnation*, *[[Resurrection]]*, *[[True Resurrection]]*, or even a *[[Miracle]]* or a *Wish*. Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is then still dead).

**Focus:** A black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)
