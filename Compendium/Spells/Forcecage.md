## Forcecage

Cube or cage of force imprisons all inside.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Evocation [Force]  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 7  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** Barred cage (20-ft. cube) or windowless cell (10-ft. cube)  
- **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

### Description

This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either **bars of force** or **solid walls of force** (your choice).

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are **too large** to fit, in which case the spell automatically **fails**. Teleportation and other forms of **astral travel** provide a means of escape, but the walls extend into the **Ethereal Plane**, blocking **ethereal travel**.

Like [[Wall of Force]], Forcecage resists [[Dispel Magic]], but it is **vulnerable to**:
- [[Disintegrate]]  
- Sphere of Annihilation  
- Rod of Cancellation  

#### Barred Cage

- Produces a **20-foot cube** of bands of force  
- Bands: **½ inch wide**, **½ inch gaps**  
- Creatures able to squeeze through gaps can escape  
- Creatures inside have **cover** against narrow weapons (e.g., arrows)  
- **Spells and breath weapons** can pass through the bars  
- Melee attacks are limited unless the weapon fits through the gaps

#### Windowless Cell

- Produces a **10-foot cube**  
- Solid walls of force on all six sides  
- No way in or out

### Material Component

- **Ruby dust worth 1,500 gp**, tossed into the air and disappears when casting
