<p>This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain concealment (20% miss chance).

Higher level light spells are not affected by <i>darkness.</i></p><p>If <i>darkness</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.</p><p><i>Darkness</i> counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.</p>
