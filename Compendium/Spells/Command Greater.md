## Command, Greater

As [[Command]], but affects one subject/level.

* **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]  
* **Level:** Clr 5  
* **Components:** V  
* **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
* **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
* **Effect:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
* **Duration:** 1 round/level  
* **Saving Throw:** Will negates  
* **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell functions like *[[command]]*, except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
