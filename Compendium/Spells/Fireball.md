### Description

A Fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals **1d6 points of fire damage per caster level** (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. **Unattended objects** also take this damage. The explosion creates almost **no pressure**.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from your finger and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to reaching the prescribed range, blossoms into the Fireball at that point. *(An early impact results in early detonation.)*

If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage (e.g., an arrow slit), you must **hit** the opening with a **ranged touch attack**, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The Fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can **melt metals** with low melting points (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the spell may continue beyond the barrier **if space permits**; otherwise, it stops there like any other spell effect.

### Material Component

- A tiny ball of **bat guano and sulfur**
