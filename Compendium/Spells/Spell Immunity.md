## Spell Immunity

Subject is immune to one spell per four levels.

- **School:** Abjuration  
- **Level:** Clr 4, Protection 4, Strength 4  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** Creature touched  
- **Duration:** 10 min./level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)  

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four caster levels you have. The protected spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding those specified spells.

However, immunity doesn't protect against spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. *Spell Immunity* covers spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does **not** protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.

Only a **particular spell** can be selected for protectionâ€”*not* a domain, school, or group of similar effects.

A creature can have only one *Spell Immunity* or *[[Spell Immunity Greater|Greater Spell Immunity]]* spell active at a time.
