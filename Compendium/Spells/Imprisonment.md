Entombs subject beneath the earth.

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Effect:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

<p>When you cast <i>imprisonment</i> and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the <i>temporal stasis</i> spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a <i>freedom</i> spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a <i>crystal ball,</i> a <i>locate object</i> spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but <i>discern location</i> does. A <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save.</p>
