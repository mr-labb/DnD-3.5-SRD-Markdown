### Description

This spell functions like [[Dispel Evil]], but instead targets **chaotic** rather than evil creatures and effects. While active, you are surrounded by a constant aura of **blue lawful energy**, which provides:

- A **+4 bonus** on attack rolls against **chaotic creatures**
- Defensive bonuses against chaotic effects, spells, or enchantments  
- Additional protections or effects similar to those granted by [[Dispel Evil]], but aligned against chaos

### Additional Notes

- Specific saving throw and spell resistance interactions depend on the context in which the spell is used (banishment, protection, dispelling, etc.)  
- The spell affects chaotic extraplanar entities, enchantments, and magic with the chaotic descriptor
