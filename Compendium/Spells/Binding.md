## Binding

Utilizes an array of techniques to imprison a creature.

*   Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** One minute
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Effect:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** See text (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A *binding* spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.

You may have up to six assistants contribute to the casting. Each assistant who casts *suggestion* increases your caster level by 1 for this casting; assistants who cast *dominate animal*, *person*, or *monster* contribute +⅓ their caster level if appropriate. These spells are only used to enhance the binding’s potency—saving throws and resistance against them are ignored.

Your caster level influences:
- Whether the target receives an initial saving throw
- The duration of certain variants

All *binding* spells are dismissible.

You may specify trigger conditions that release the bound creature; these increase the save DC by 2. Conditions must be observable and reasonable—not abstract metrics like level or hit points.

If overlapping durations are used, the target gets a save at the end of the first spell. A success ends all bindings.

### Binding Versions

Pick one version when casting:

- **Chaining:** Confines the subject with restraints plus *antipathy* effect. Duration: 1 year/level. Save DC unchanged.
- **Slumber:** Induces coma. No aging or needs. Duration: 1 year/level. Save DC –1.
- **Bound Slumber:** Combines *chaining* and *slumber*. Duration: 1 month/level. Save DC –2.
- **Hedged Prison:** Seals the subject in a confined space. Permanent. Save DC –3.
- **Metamorphosis:** Transforms into gaseous form (face remains), trapped in a container. Permanent. Save DC –4.
- **Minimus Containment:** Shrinks subject to under 1 inch, stores it in a gem or jar. Permanent. Save DC –4.

Cannot be dispelled with *dispel magic*, but is affected by *antimagic field* or *Mage’s disjunction*. Extraplanar targets are immune to *dismissal*, *banishment*, etc.
