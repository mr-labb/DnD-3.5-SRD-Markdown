## Transformation

You gain combat bonuses.

- **School:** Transmutation  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal  
- **Effect:** You  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Not specified  
- **Spell Resistance:** Not specified  

You become a virtual fighting machineâ€”stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mindset shifts to one that relishes battle, and you **lose all ability to cast spells**, including spells from magic items.

You gain the following benefits:
- +4 enhancement bonus to **Strength**, **Dexterity**, and **Constitution**  
- +4 **natural armor** bonus to AC  
- +5 competence bonus on **Fortitude saves**  
- Proficiency with all **simple and martial weapons**  
- Your **base attack bonus equals your character level**, potentially granting multiple attacks

You lose your spellcasting ability and cannot use spell activation or spell completion magic items, as if the spells were no longer on your class list.

**Material Component:** A *potion of [[Bulls Strength|bull's strength]]*, which must be consumed during casting (its effects are absorbed into the spell).
