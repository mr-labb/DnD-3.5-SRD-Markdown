This spell functions like <i>[[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]],</i> except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has a level restored by restoration has exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level.

<i>Restoration</i> cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.

<i>Restoration</i> does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

<i>Material Component:</i> Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the target.
