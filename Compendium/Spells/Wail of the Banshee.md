## Wail of the Banshee

Kills one creature/level with a deadly scream.

- **School:** Necromancy [Death, Sonic]  
- **Level:** Death 9, Sor/Wiz 9  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** One living creature/level within a 40-ft.-radius spread  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

You release an unearthly wail that reverberates through reality, targeting up to one living creature per caster level within a **40-foot radius spread**. The scream kills each affected target unless they succeed on a **Fortitude save**.

- Creatures closest to the spell’s origin are affected first.
- Spell resistance applies to each target individually.
- The caster is immune to their own death wail.

This is one of the most feared spells in necromantic magic—efficient, lethal, and utterly chilling.
