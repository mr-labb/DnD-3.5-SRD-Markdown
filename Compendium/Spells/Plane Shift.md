As many as eight subjects travel to another plane.

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates

<p>You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the <i>plane shift</i> at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination.</p><p><i>Note: Plane shift</i> transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.</p>
