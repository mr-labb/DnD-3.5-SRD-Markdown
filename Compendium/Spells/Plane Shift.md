## Plane Shift

As many as eight subjects travel to another plane.

- **School**: Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level**: Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 7  
- **Components**: V, S, F  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Touch  
- **Effect**: Creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands  
- **Duration**: Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw**: Will negates  
- **Spell Resistance**: Yes  

## Description

You move yourself or another creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing individuals link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the spell simultaneously.

Precise accuracy as to a specific arrival location on the intended plane is nearly impossible. From the Material Plane, you may reach any other plane, although arrival will typically be 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from the intended destination.

Note: *Plane Shift* transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. Returning requires another method.

## Focus

A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type determines which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.
