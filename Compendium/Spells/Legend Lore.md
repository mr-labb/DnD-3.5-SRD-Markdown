### Description

*Legend Lore* brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing.

- If the subject is **present** or you are **in the location**:  
  - **Casting time**: 1d4×10 minutes

During casting, you may only perform routine activities (eating, sleeping, etc.). Upon completion, the spell reveals legends—current or forgotten—about the subject. If the subject lacks legendary significance, you gain no information.

As a guideline, subjects are considered legendary if they are level 11 or higher, possess major magic items, or are involved in significant events.

### Material Component

Incense worth at least 250 gp.

### Focus

Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle.
