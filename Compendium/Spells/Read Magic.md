<p>By means of <i>read magic,</i> you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls, weapons, and the like - that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of <i>read magic.</i> You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding</i> with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a <i>greater glyph of warding</i> with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any <i>symbol</i> spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).</p><p><i>Read magic</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A clear crystal or mineral prism.</p>
