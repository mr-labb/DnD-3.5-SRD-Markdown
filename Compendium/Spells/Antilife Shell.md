## Antilife Shell

10-ft. field hedges out living creatures.

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Animal 6, Clr 6, Drd 6
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Casting Time:** 1 round
*   **Range:** 10 ft.
*   **Effect:** 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

<p>You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures.</p><p>The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead.</p><p>This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.</p>
