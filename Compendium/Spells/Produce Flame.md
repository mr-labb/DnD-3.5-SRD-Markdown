## Description

Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies:

- **Melee touch attack**: Deals fire damage equal to **1d6 + 1 per caster level** (maximum +5).
- **Ranged touch attack**: Can be hurled up to **120 feet** as a thrown weapon (no range penalty), dealing the same damage.

Once hurled, a **new flame appears** in your hand.  
Each attack **reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute**.  
If an attack lowers the duration to **0 minutes or less**, the spell ends **after the attack resolves**.

This spell **does not function underwater**.
