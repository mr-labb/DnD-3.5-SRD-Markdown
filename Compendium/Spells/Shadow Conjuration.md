## Description

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. *Shadow Conjuration* can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.

*Shadow conjurations* are one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe them to be real are affected at full strength.

Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.

Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur.

Regardless of the save to disbelieve, the affected creature is also allowed any save granted by the spell being mimicked. The save DC is based on *Shadow Conjuration*'s level (4th) rather than the original spellâ€™s level.

Any effect created by *Shadow Conjuration* allows spell resistance, even if the mimicked spell does not.

Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against disbelievers, who resist them 80% of the time.

A shadow creature has:
- One-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind  
- Full damage and abilities if not recognized as shadowy  
- One-fifth (20%) damage and only 20% chance for non-lethal special abilities if recognized  
- One-fifth AC bonuses  

Disbelievers see *Shadow Conjurations* as transparent images over vague, shadowy forms.

Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.
