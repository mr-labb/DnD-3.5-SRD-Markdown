## Command Undead

Undead creature obeys your commands.

* **School:** Necromancy  
* **Level:** Sor/Wiz 2  
* **Components:** V, S, M  
* **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
* **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

* **Duration:** One day/level  
* **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text

This spell allows you some degree of control over an undead creature.

- **Intelligent undead:**  
  - Treat your words and actions in the most favorable way (attitude = friendly).  
  - Will not attack you during the spell's duration.  
  - You may issue orders, but must win an **opposed Charisma check** to compel actions they wouldn’t normally do.  
  - No retries allowed.  
  - Will not obey suicidal or obviously harmful instructions (may accept very dangerous ones).

- **Nonintelligent undead:**  
  - **No saving throw**.  
  - Obey **basic commands** only (“come,” “go,” “fight,” “stand still,” etc.).  
  - Will comply with suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

- Any **threatening action** by you or your allies **breaks the spell**, regardless of the undead’s intelligence.

- Commands must be **spoken** — they are **not telepathic**.

**Material Component:** A shred of raw meat and a splinter of bone.
