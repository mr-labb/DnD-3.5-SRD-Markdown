## Ventriloquism

Throws voice for 1 min./level.

- **School:** Illusion (Figment)  
- **Level:** Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1  
- **Components:** V, F  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** Intelligible sound, usually speech  
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)  
- **Spell Resistance:** No  

You can make your voice—or any sound you can naturally produce—appear to come from a location other than your own. The illusion includes intelligible speech and can be in any language you know. If a creature interacts with the sound and succeeds on a Will save, it identifies the source as illusory, though it still hears it clearly.

- **Focus:** A parchment rolled into a small cone.
