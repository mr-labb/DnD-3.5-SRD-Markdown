### Description

Casting a *Gate* spell has two primary effects:

#### Planar Travel

You create an interdimensional connection between your plane and one you specify, allowing travel in either direction.  
- The gate appears as a circular hoop or disk, 5 to 20 feet in diameter (chosen by the caster), oriented as desired  
- It is a two-dimensional window into the selected plane  
- Creatures entering from the **front** are transported; those entering from the **back** are not  
- Functions like [[Plane Shift]], but opens precisely at the designated location  
- Cannot open to another location on the same plane  
- You may concentrate to hold the gate open for **up to 1 round per caster level**

*Note:* Deities or powerful planar rulers may prevent a gate from opening in their presence or domain.

#### Calling Creatures

You may call a particular extraplanar individual or kind of being to your aid.  
- The gate opens near the creature and pulls it through  
- Deities and unique beings are **not compelled** to come  
- The gate remains open just long enough for transport

XP Cost: **1,000 XP** (only when calling creatures)

Calling by kind:
- Call **one creature of any HD**, or several whose total HD ≤ your caster level  
- Can control one creature if its HD ≤ twice your caster level  
- Cannot control a creature with HD > 2× caster level  
- **Uncontrolled beings** act on their own and may return freely

Controlled beings may perform:
- **Immediate tasks** (completed within duration) — no reward required  
- **Contractual service** — requires fair exchange or compensation  
  - Reward must be reasonable and prompt  
  - Failure to deliver may result in vengeance from the creature or its superiors

*Note:* Using Gate to call an elemental or alignment-based creature classifies it as a spell of that type (e.g., [Fire], [Evil], [Lawful]).

### XP Cost

- **1,000 XP** when used to **call creatures**
