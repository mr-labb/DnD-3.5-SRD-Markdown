2. **Banishment Effect:**  
   - On a successful **melee touch attack** against a **good extraplanar creature**, you may attempt to send it back to its home plane  
   - Target may resist with a **Will saving throw** (spell resistance applies)  
   - This effect **ends** the spell

3. **Dispel Good Magic:**  
   - By touch, automatically dispel:
     - One **enchantment** spell cast by a good creature  
     - Or one **good-aligned** spell  
   - Spells unaffected by [[Dispel Magic]] are also unaffected by [[Dispel Good]]  
   - No saving throw or spell resistance applies  
   - This effect also **ends** the spell
