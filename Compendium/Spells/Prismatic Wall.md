## Description

*Prismatic Wall* creates a vertical, opaque wallâ€”a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each with distinct powers.

- Creatures with less than 8 HD within 20 ft. of the wall are **blinded for 2d4 rounds** upon looking at it.  
- The wall is **immobile**, and you can pass through or remain near it **without harm**.  
- Maximum dimensions: **4 ft. wide/level**, **2 ft. high/level**.  
- If cast in a space occupied by a creature, the spell **fails**.  

Each color in the wall has a specific effect on creatures attempting to attack or pass through it, and can be negated by a specific magical effect. The colors must be removed in order (red before orange, etc.).

- A *rod of cancellation* or *[[Mages Disjunction]]* can **destroy the entire wall**.  
- *[[Antimagic field]]* fails to penetrate the wall.  
- *[[Dispel Magic]]* and *[[Dispel Magic Greater|Greater Dispel Magic]]* **cannot** affect the wall.  
- Spell resistance applies **against each color** separately.

*Prismatic Wall* can be made **permanent** with *[[Permanency]]*.
