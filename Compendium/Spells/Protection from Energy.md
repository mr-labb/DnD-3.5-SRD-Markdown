*Protection from Energy* grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (**acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic**). When the spell absorbs **12 points per caster level** of energy damage (maximum **120 points at 10th level**), it is discharged.

**Note**: *Protection from Energy* overlaps (and does **not stack** with) *[[Resist Energy]]*. If a character is warded by both *Protection from Energy* and *[[Resist Energy]]*, the *protection* spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.
