When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.</p><p><i>Note: Protection from energy</i> overlaps (and does not stack with) <i>resist energy.</i> If a character is warded by <i>protection from energy</i> and <i>resist energy,</i> the <i>protection</i> spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.</p>
