### Description

This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian.

- The tree must be located within 10 feet of your **dwelling**, within a **sacred place**, or within **300 feet of something you wish to guard**.  
- The spell must be cast on a **healthy, Huge oak**.  
- A **triggering phrase** of up to one word per caster level is placed on the tree.

Once activated, the *liveoak* animates as a **[[treant]]**.

If the spell is:
- **Dispelled**: the tree immediately takes root where it stands.  
- **Released** by you: it attempts to return to its original location before taking root.
