<p>This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while <i>liveoak</i> is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect.</p><p><i>Liveoak</i> must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The <i>liveoak</i> spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.</p><p>If <i>liveoak</i> is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.</p>
