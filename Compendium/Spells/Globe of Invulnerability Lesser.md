### Description

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of **3rd level or lower**.  
- The **area or effect** of such spells does **not** include the area within the [[Globe of Invulnerability Lesser|Lesser Globe of Invulnerability]]  
- Such spells fail to affect any target inside the globe  
- Excludes **spell-like abilities** and **spells from magical items**

However:
- Any type of spell can be **cast through or out** of the globe  
- Spells of **4th level and higher** are **not affected**  
- Spells already in effect when the globe is cast are **not disrupted**

The globe can be brought down by a **targeted [[Dispel Magic]]**, but not by an area dispel.

Spell effects are **suppressed** rather than dispelled when entering the globe.  
If a spell’s level varies by caster class, use the level appropriate to the **casting class** to determine whether it’s blocked.

### Material Component

- A **glass or crystal bead** that shatters when the spell ends.
