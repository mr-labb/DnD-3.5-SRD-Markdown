This spell causes the targets to become [[confused]], rendering them unable to determine their actions independently. Roll on the following table at the start of each affected creature’s turn to determine its behavior:

| d%     | Behavior                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–10  | Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons, or move toward caster.       |
| 11–20  | Act normally.                                                            |
| 21–50  | Babble incoherently and take no other action.                            |
| 51–70  | Flee from caster at top speed.                                           |
| 71–100 | Attack nearest creature (familiars count as part of self).               |

- If the subject cannot carry out the rolled action, it babbles incoherently.
- Attacking a confused target does not grant special advantage.
- Any confused creature that is attacked retaliates on its next turn if still confused.
- Confused characters do **not** make attacks of opportunity unless already committed to attacking that target.

**Arcane Material Component:**  
A set of three nut shells.
