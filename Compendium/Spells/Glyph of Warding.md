### Description

This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A Glyph of Warding can guard a bridge, passage, portal, chest, box, etc.

You set the conditions for triggering:
- Commonly triggered by entering/opening without speaking a password
- May be triggered by: physical characteristics, creature type/subtype/kind, alignment traits (good, evil, law, chaos), religious affiliation
- Cannot be triggered by class, Hit Dice, or level
- Responds to invisible creatures; unaffected by ethereal travelers
- Only one glyph per area; separate objects (e.g. drawers) may each be warded

Upon casting, a glowing tracery is woven into the glyph. Once finished, the glyph becomes nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be bypassed by probing, physical or magical. They can be dispelled, and effects like [[Mislead]], [[Polymorph]], and [[Nondetection]] can fool them. [[Read Magic]] with a DC 13 Spellcraft check identifies the glyph without discharging it.

*Note:* Only a rogue can find and disable glyphs with Search and Disable Device; DC = 25 + spell level (i.e., 28 for Glyph of Warding).

#### Blast Glyph

- Deals **1d8 damage per 2 caster levels** (max 5d8) to intruder and others within 5 ft.
- Damage type: **acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic** (choose at casting)
- Reflex save for half damage  
- Spell resistance applies

#### Spell Glyph

- Store any **harmful spell of 3rd level or lower**
- Effects are based on caster level at glyph's creation
- Targets intruder or is centered on them (if area/amorphous)
- Summoned creatures appear near the intruder and attack
- Saving throws and spell resistance apply; DC based on stored spellâ€™s level

### Material Component

- **Incense**, sprinkled with **powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp**, used to trace the glyph
