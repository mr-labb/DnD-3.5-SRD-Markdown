## Forceful Hand

Hand pushes creatures away.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Evocation [Force]  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 6  
- **Components:** V, S, F  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect:** 10-ft. hand  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

### Description

This spell functions like [[Interposing Hand]], except that the Forceful Hand pursues and **pushes away** the opponent you designate. Treat the attack as a **bull rush** with a **+14 bonus** on the Strength check:  
- +8 for Strength 27  
- +4 for being Large  
- +2 for charging (always applies)

The hand **moves with the target** to push it the full allowed distance. It has **no speed limit**.

You may **redirect the hand** to a new target by using a **move action**.

A very strong creature cannot push the hand aside, as it instantly **repositions** between the creature and you. However, an opponent may **bull rush the hand** toward you.

### Focus

- A **sturdy glove** made of leather or heavy cloth
