## Forbiddance

Blocks planar travel, damages creatures of different alignment.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Abjuration  
- **Level:** Clr 6  
- **Components:** V, S, M, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 6 rounds  
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect:** 60-ft. cube/level (S)  
- **Duration:** Permanent  
- **Saving Throw:** See text  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

### Description

Forbiddance seals an area against all **planar travel** into or within it. This includes teleportation spells (such as [[Dimension Door]] and [[Teleport]]), **plane shifting**, **astral travel**, **ethereal travel**, and **summoning spells**. These effects automatically **fail**.

In addition, it **damages creatures** entering whose alignments differ from yours:

- **Identical alignment:** No effect. Entry allowed (but not by planar travel).
- **Different by either law/chaos or good/evil:** Creature takes **6d6 damage**.  
  - Will save halves damage  
  - Spell resistance applies
- **Different by both law/chaos and good/evil:** Creature takes **12d6 damage**.  
  - Will save halves damage  
  - Spell resistance applies

A creature within the area at casting is unaffected unless it **leaves and reenters**.

You may specify a **password** during casting to allow creatures of different alignment to enter without damage.

### Notes

- [[Dispel Magic]] only affects Forbiddance if the caster level matches or exceeds your own.
- Multiple overlapping Forbiddance spells are not allowed. The newer effect ends at the border of the older one.

### Material Component

- **Holy water** and **rare incenses** worth at least:
  - 1,500 gp + 1,500 gp per 60-ft. cube  
  - +1,000 gp per 60-ft. cube if a password is included (requires burning additional rare incense)
