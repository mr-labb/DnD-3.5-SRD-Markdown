## Arcane Lock

Magically locks a portal or chest.

*   Abjuration
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V, S, M
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Effect:** The door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level in size
*   **Duration:** Permanent
*   **Saving Throw:** None

An *arcane lock* spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own *arcane lock* without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful *[[dispel magic]]* or *[[knock]]* spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. (A *[[knock]]* spell does not remove an *arcane lock*; it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.)

*Material Component:* Gold dust worth 25 gp.
