<p>A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the <i>flame blade</i> are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A <i>flame blade</i> can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.</p><p>The spell does not function underwater.</p>
