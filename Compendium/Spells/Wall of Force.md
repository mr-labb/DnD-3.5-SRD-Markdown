## Wall of Force

Wall is immune to damage.

- **School:** Evocation [Force]  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5  
- **Components:** V, S, M  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** None

*Wall of Force* creates an invisible, immobile barrier of magical energy. The wall is immune to all forms of damage and cannot be dispelled by *[[Dispel Magic]]*. However, it is instantly destroyed by *[[Disintegrate]]*, a *Rod of Cancellation*, a *Sphere of Annihilation*, or a *[[Mages Disjunction|Mageâ€™s Disjunction]]*.

Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, but teleportation effects like *[[Dimension Door]]* or *[[Teleport]]* can bypass it. The wall blocks both material and ethereal creatures, though ethereal ones may circumvent it by moving through solid matter. Gaze attacks are unaffected and can operate through the wall.

You can shape the wall as a flat, vertical plane with a surface area of up to one 10-foot square per caster level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed; if any object or creature obstructs its creation, the spell fails.

*Wall of Force* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency]]* spell.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of powder made from a clear gem.
