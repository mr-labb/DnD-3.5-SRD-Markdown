This spell functions like *silent image*, but its figment activates based on a **triggering condition** defined at casting. The illusion incorporates **visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements**, and can include **intelligible speech**.

- **Trigger conditions**: Must be sensoryâ€”audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual. Cannot rely on non-obvious qualities like alignment.  
- See *[[magic mouth]]* for details on appropriate trigger design.

Once triggered, the figment behaves as a dynamic illusion with full sensory details, lasting **1 round per caster level**.

> **Material Component**: A bit of fleece and **jade dust worth 25 gp**.
