## Wish

As [[Limited Wish]], but with fewer limits.

- **School:** Universal  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9  
- **Components:** V, XP  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** See text  
- **Effect:** See text  
- **Duration:** See text  
- **Saving Throw:** See text  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

*Wish* is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.

Even *wish*, however, has its limits.

A *wish* can produce any one of the following effects:

- Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a prohibited school.
- Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a prohibited school.
- Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
- Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.
- Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as *[[Geas_Quest|Geas/Quest]]* or *[[Insanity]]*.
- Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.
- Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.
- Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five *wish* spells cast in succession can grant a +2 to +5 bonus. The inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 and does not stack.
- Remove injuries and afflictions affecting one creature per caster level, cured of the same affliction type. Cannot restore XP loss or lost levels/Con from [[resurrection]].
- Revive the dead by duplicating *[[Resurrection]]*. If the body is destroyed, two *wish* spells are needed. Does not prevent XP loss from being revived.
- Transport travelers from any plane to any other plane (one creature per caster level). Will save negates for unwilling targets; spell resistance applies.
- Undo misfortune by forcing a reroll of any roll made in the last round. Reality reshapes to match the result. Will save and spell resistance apply for unwilling targets.

You may attempt greater effects, but doing so is dangerous and may result in undesirable or partial outcomes.

Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal, but DCs are for 9th-level spells.

- **Material Component:** If duplicating a spell with a material cost over 10,000 gp, you must provide it.
- **XP Cost:** Minimum 5,000 XP. If duplicating a spell with an XP cost, pay the higher of 5,000 XP or the duplicated cost. Creating or improving a magic item costs double the standard XP cost plus 5,000 XP.
