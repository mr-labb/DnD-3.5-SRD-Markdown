### Description

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A Phantom Steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount has:
- AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex)  
- 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level  
- Speed of 20 feet per caster level, maximum 240 feet  
- Carrying capacity: rider + 10 pounds per caster level  

Mount powers by caster level (includes lower-level abilities):

- **8th Level**: Can ride over sandy, muddy, or swampy ground with no difficulty or speed reduction.  
- **10th Level**: Can use [[Water Walk]] at will (as the spell, no action required).  
- **12th Level**: Can use [[Air Walk]] at will for up to 1 round; then falls to the ground.  
- **14th Level**: Can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).
