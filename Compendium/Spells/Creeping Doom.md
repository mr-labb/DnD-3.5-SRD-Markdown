Upon casting [[Creeping Doom]], you summon a mass of centipede swarmsâ€”one per two caster levels (maximum 10 swarms at 20th level). Swarms may be positioned independently and do not need to appear adjacent to one another.

- Swarms may share space with existing creatures.
- By default, swarms remain stationary and attack any creature in their area.
- As a **standard action**, you may command any number of swarms to move toward a target within **100 feet**.
- A swarm cannot move beyond **100 feet** from you. If you move more than 100 feet away from a swarm, it becomes stationary but resumes movement if you return within range.
