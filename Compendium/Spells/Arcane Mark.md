## Arcane Mark

Inscribes a personal rune (visible or invisible).

*   Universal
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 0
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** 0 ft.
*   **Effect:** One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
*   **Duration:** Permanent
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An *arcane mark* spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a *[[detect magic]]* spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

*[[See invisibility]]*, *[[true seeing]]*, a *gem of seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible *arcane mark*. A *[[read magic]]* spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *[[erase]]* spell.

If an *arcane mark* is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

*Arcane mark* must be cast on an object prior to casting *[[instant summons]]* on the same object (see that spell description for details).
