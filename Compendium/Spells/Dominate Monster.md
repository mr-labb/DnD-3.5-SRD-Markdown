## Dominate Monster

As Dominate Person, but any creature.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 9  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 round  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** One creature  
- **Duration:** One day/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

### Description

This is the most powerful form of magical domination available. It functions like [[Dominate Person]] but applies to **any type of creature**, regardless of type (humanoid, magical beast, outsider, dragon, etc.).

- Establishes a **mental link** between you and the target  
- Allows **silent mental commands**  
- Target obeys even complex instructions, depending on your control and its Intelligence  
- **Suicidal or overtly self-destructive commands** may be resisted or ignored, per GM discretion

You retain control as long as the creature remains within range and under the spellâ€™s duration. The long duration makes this ideal for controlling powerful enemies, turning them into allies (or at least tools) for extended quests or conflicts.
