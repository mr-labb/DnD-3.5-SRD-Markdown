<p>The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).</p><p>A <i>see invisibility</i> spell does not counteract the <i>blur</i> effect, but a <i>true seeing</i> spell does.</p><p>Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).</p>
