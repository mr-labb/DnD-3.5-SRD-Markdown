## Blur

Attacks miss subject 20% of the time.

*   Illusion (Glamer)
*   **Level:** Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
*   **Components:** V
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Effect:** Creature touched
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This visual distortion grants the subject **concealment**, resulting in a **20% miss chance** on attacks.

- *See invisibility* does **not** negate the effect.
- *True seeing* **does** counteract the blur.
- Opponents who **cannot see** the subject ignore the spellâ€™s effect (though attacking unseen targets incurs its own penalties).
