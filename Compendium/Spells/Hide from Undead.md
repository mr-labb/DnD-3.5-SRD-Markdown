## Hide from Undead

Undead can't perceive one subject/level.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Abjuration  
- **Level:** Clr 1  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** One touched creature/level  
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless); see text  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

### Description

Undead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities—such as **blindsense**, **blindsight**, **scent**, and **tremorsense**—cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not present.

An **intelligent undead** creature gets **one Will saving throw**. If it fails, it cannot perceive the warded creatures. However, if the undead suspects unseen foes are nearby, it may attempt to locate or attack them.

If a warded creature:
- **Attempts to turn or [[command undead]]**
- **Touches an undead creature**
- **Attacks any creature (even with a spell)**

...the spell immediately **ends for all recipients**.
