## Word of Recall

Teleports you back to designated place.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Clr 6, Drd 8  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Unlimited  
- **Effect:** You and touched objects or other willing creatures  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (harmless, object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (harmless, object)  

*Word of recall* teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.

You can transport, in addition to yourself:

- Any objects you carry, up to your maximum load  
- One additional willing Medium or smaller creature per three caster levels  
  - Large = two Medium creatures  
  - Huge = two Large creatures, etc.  

All transported creatures must be in contact with one another, and at least one must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.

Unwilling creatures cannot be teleported by *word of recall*. A creature's Will save or spell resistance can prevent items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.
