### Description

*Interposing hand* creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand remains between the two of you, regardless of movement, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. It ignores darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, and disguises. The hand does not pursue a retreating opponent.

The hand is 10 feet long and wide, with fingers outstretched. It has hit points equal to your undamaged HP and AC 20 (–1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most nondamaging magical effects do not affect it.

- Does not provoke attacks of opportunity  
- Cannot penetrate a [[Wall of Force]] or enter an [[Antimagic Field]]  
- Affected normally by [[Prismatic Wall]] and [[Prismatic Sphere]]  
- Makes saving throws as its caster  
- Can be destroyed by [[Disintegrate]] or a successful [[Dispel Magic]]

Creatures ≤ 2,000 pounds are slowed to half speed when pushing past the hand. Heavier creatures are not slowed, but their attacks are still affected.

Redirecting the hand to a new target requires a move action.

### Focus

A soft glove.
