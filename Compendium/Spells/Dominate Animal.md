- "Attack"  
- "Run"  
- "Fetch"

#### Behavior and Limits

- **Self-destructive or suicidal orders** (e.g., attacking a creature 2+ size categories larger) are **ignored**
- The **mental link** allows control even without line of sight  
- You **do not receive sensory input**, but you intuitively know what the creature experiences  
- The animal may perform tasks normally **beyond its understanding**, guided by your intelligence  
- You **don’t need to concentrate** to maintain control unless directing unfamiliar actions  
- Issuing a new command is a **move action**, like redirecting a spell

Dominate Animal is a versatile tool in a druid’s arsenal—turning the wilds into your tactical allies.
