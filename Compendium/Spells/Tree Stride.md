## Tree Stride

Step from one tree to another far away.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Drd 5, Rgr 4  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal  
- **Effect:** You  
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level or until expended; see text  
- **Saving Throw:** Not specified  
- **Spell Resistance:** Not specified  

You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to another tree of the same kind. All trees used must be **living** and have a **girth at least equal to yours**.

Upon entering a tree (e.g., an oak), you immediately become aware of the location of all other trees of the same type within your transport range and may choose whether to pass into one or exit the tree.

### Tree Transport Range by Type

| Type of Tree          | Transport Range |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Oak, ash, yew         | 3,000 feet      |
| Elm, linden           | 2,000 feet      |
| Other deciduous       | 1,500 feet      |
| Any coniferous        | 1,000 feet      |
| All other trees       | 500 feet        |

You may **enter a tree once per caster level**. Each movement into a tree (including transport) counts as one use. The spell ends when the duration expires or once you exit a tree. **Each transport takes a full-round action.**

- You may choose to remain inside a tree, but are **forced out when the spell ends**
- If the tree you occupy is **destroyed** (chopped or burned), you are **instantly slain**
- You **cannot travel through plant creatures**
