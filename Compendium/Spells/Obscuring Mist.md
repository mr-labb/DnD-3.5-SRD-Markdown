<p>A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).</p><p>A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a <i>gust of wind</i> spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A <i>fireball, flame strike</i>, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A <i>wall of fire</i> burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.</p><p>This spell does not function underwater.</p>
