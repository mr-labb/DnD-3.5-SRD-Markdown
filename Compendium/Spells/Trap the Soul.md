## Trap the Soul

Imprisons subject within gem.

- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 8  
- **Components:** V, S, M, (F); see text

Trap the Soul forces a creature's **life force (and body)** into a gem. The gem holds the creature **indefinitely**, or until it is **broken**, releasing the soul and allowing the body to reform.

If the trapped creature is an **extraplanar entity**, it may be **bound to perform a service** when released. Otherwise, the creature goes free once the gem is destroyed.

### Spell Trigger Methods

#### Spell Completion
- Cast normally, speaking the final word  
- Creature may attempt a **Will save** and use **spell resistance**  
- If the creature's **name is spoken**, SR is ignored and **save DC increases by 2**  
- If the save succeeds or SR prevails, the gem **shatters**

#### Trigger Object
- Use a **prepared object** inscribed with the final word and the creatureâ€™s name  
- May include a [[Sympathy]] spell to lure the target  
- When picked up/accepted, the soul is **automatically trapped**  
- No save, no spell resistance applies

### Components

- **Material Component:**  
  - A gem worth **at least 1,000 gp/HD** of the target creature  
  - If the gem is underpriced, it shatters upon casting

- **Focus (Trigger Object Only):**  
  - A special object inscribed with the creature's name and trigger word
