<p>You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see <i>raise dead</i>). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.</p><p>The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A pinch of salt, and a copper piece for each eye the corpse has (or had).</p>
