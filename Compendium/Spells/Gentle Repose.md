### Description

You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see [[Raise Dead]]). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

### Arcane Material Component

A pinch of **salt**, and a **copper piece for each eye** the corpse has (or had).
