## Song of Discord

Forces targets to attack each other.

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Sonic]  
- **Level:** Brd 5  
- **Components:** V, S  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect:** Creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread  
- **Duration:** 1 round/level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round.

Creatures forced by a *Song of Discord* to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.
