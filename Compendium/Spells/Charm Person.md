This spell makes a humanoid creature regard you as a trusted friend and ally (as if its attitude were "friendly").

- If the target is currently **threatened or attacked** by you or your allies, it receives a **+5 bonus** on its saving throw.
- The charmed target is **not under direct control**, but interprets your words and actions favorably.
- You may issue **suggestions or commands**, but anything it wouldn’t normally do requires an **opposed Charisma check** (no retries allowed).
- The target **never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful instructions**, though risky actions may be persuaded.
- **Any threat or damage** from you or your allies **breaks the charm immediately**.
- You must be able to **speak the creature’s language** or use clear pantomime to communicate.
