<p>The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. <i>Mind blank</i> even foils <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, and <i>wish</i> spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as <i>arcane eye,</i> the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.</p>
