<p>You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.</p><table> <tr decoration="underline"> <td colspan="2"> <b>Knowledge</b> </td> <td> <b>Will Save Modifier</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> None* </td> <td> +10 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) </td> <td> +5 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Firsthand (you have met the subject) </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Familiar (you know the subject well) </td> <td> -5 </td> </tr> <tr><td></td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> * You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of. </td> </tr> <tr><td></td></tr> <tr decoration="underline"> <td colspan="2"> <b>Connection</b> </td> <td> <b>Will Save Modifier</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Likeness or picture </td> <td> -2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Possession or garment </td> <td> -4 </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"> Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. </td> <td> -10 </td> </tr> </table><p>If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).
