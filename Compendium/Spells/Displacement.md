<p>The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, unlike actual total concealment, <i>displacement</i> does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. <i>True seeing</i> reveals its true location.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> A small strip of leather twisted into a loop.</p>
