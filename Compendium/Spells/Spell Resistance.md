## Spell Resistance

Subject gains SR equal to 12 + caster level.

- **School:** Abjuration  
- **Level:** Clr 5, Magic 5, Protection 5  
- **Components:** V, S, DF  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Touch  
- **Effect:** Creature touched  
- **Duration:** 1 min./level  
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)  

The touched creature gains **Spell Resistance** (SR) equal to **12 + your caster level**. This resistance applies to spells and spell-like abilities that allow SR, making it harder for foes' spells to affect the creature.

Useful for mid-level encounters where enemy casters are numerous and you need reliable magical protection without specifying which spells to resist.
