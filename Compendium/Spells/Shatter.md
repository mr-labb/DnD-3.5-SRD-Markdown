## Description

*Shatter* creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.

Used as an area attack, *shatter* destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per caster level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.

Alternatively, you can target *shatter* against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), *shatter* deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

**Arcane Material Component**: A chip of mica.
