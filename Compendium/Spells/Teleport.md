## Teleport

Instantly transports you as far as 100 miles/level.

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)  
- **Level:** Sor/Wiz 5, Travel 5  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Personal and touch  
- **Effect:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object)  
- **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object)  

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.

You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All transported creatures must be in contact with one another, and at least one must be in contact with you.

As with personal-range spells, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or attended by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

You must have a clear mental image of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation succeeds. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may interfere or prevent teleportation.
