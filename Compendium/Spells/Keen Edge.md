## Keen Edge

Doubles normal weapon’s threat range.

### Spell Details

- **School**: Transmutation  
- **Level**: Sor/Wiz 3  
- **Components**: V, S  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect**: One weapon or fifty projectiles, all of which must be in contact with each other at the time of casting  
- **Duration**: 10 min./level  
- **Saving Throw**: Will negates (harmless, object)  
- **Spell Resistance**: Yes (harmless, object)  

### Description

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation **doubles the threat range** of the weapon:

- Threat range 20 becomes 19–20  
- Threat range 19–20 becomes 17–20  
- Threat range 18–20 becomes 15–20  

The spell can be cast **only on piercing or slashing weapons**.

- If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the [[Keen Edge]] effect on a projectile ends after one use—hit or miss.  
- Treat shuriken as arrows for the purpose of this spell.  

Notes:

- Multiple effects that increase threat range **do not stack** (e.g. [[Keen Edge]] + Improved Critical).  
- Cannot be cast on **natural weapons** (e.g. claws).
