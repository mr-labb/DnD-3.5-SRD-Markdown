<p>A <i>lesser geas</i> places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a <i>geas</i> cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.</p><p>The <i>geased</i> creature must follow the given instructions until the <i>geas</i> is completed, no matter how long it takes.</p><p>If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions:</p><p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>lesser geas</i> for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the <i>lesser geas.</i></p><p>A <i>lesser geas</i> (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> does not affect a <i>lesser geas</i>.</p>
