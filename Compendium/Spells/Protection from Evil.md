## Description

This spell wards a creature from **attacks by evil creatures**, **mental control**, and **summoned creatures**, creating a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of **1 foot**. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects:

### 1. Deflection and Resistance Bonuses  
The subject gains:  
- **+2 deflection bonus to AC**  
- **+2 resistance bonus on saves**  
These bonuses apply only against attacks made or effects created by **evil creatures**.

### 2. Blocking Possession and Mental Control  
- Prevents possession attempts (e.g., *[[Magic Jar]]*)  
- Suppresses ongoing enchantment (charm/compulsion) effects such as *[[Dominate Person]]*  
- Suppression lasts as long as *Protection from Evil* is active  
- Does **not** dispel effects already in place; it only prevents their influence  
- This effect works **regardless of alignment**

### 3. Hedge Against Summoned Creatures  
- Prevents bodily contact from **summoned evil creatures**  
- Natural weapon attacks fail if they require contact  
- Good summoned creatures are **immune** to this effect  
- The protection ends if the warded creature **attacks** or forces the barrier against the blocked creature  
- **Spell resistance** may allow a summoned creature to overcome the protection

**Arcane Material Component**: A little powdered silver used to trace a **3-foot-diameter circle** around the target.
