### Description

You create a **telepathic link** that allows you to **control the actions** of a single **humanoid** target.

#### Language & Communication

- If you share a **common language**, you can issue **complex commands**  
- Without one, you are limited to basic instructions:  
  - "Come here"  
  - "Go there"  
  - "Fight"  
  - "Stand still"  
- You **sense what the subject experiences**, but **do not receive direct sensory input**

#### Behavioral Effects

- Once commanded, the subject **continues to follow the instruction** unless survival demands otherwise  
- **Sense Motive check DC 15** can detect enchantment due to unnatural behavior  
- Issuing a new command requires a **move action**

#### Sensory Link

- By concentrating (standard action), you gain **sensory interpretation through the subject's mind**  
- Cannot **see through their eyes**, but gain a **general sense** of surroundings

#### Resistance and Range

- Actions **against the target's nature** allow a new **saving throw with +2 bonus**  
- **Self-destructive orders** are ignored  
- Control persists **regardless of distance**, as long as both are on the **same plane**

#### Maintenance & Protection

- Failure to **concentrate for 1 round/day** grants the subject a new saving throw  
- Spells like [[Protection from Evil]] block **control and communication**, but **do not end** domination
