Fearsome illusion kills subject or deals 3d6 damage.

*   Illusion (Phantasm) [Fear, Mind-Affecting]
*   **Level:** Sor/Wiz 4
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Effect:** One living creature
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with), then Fortitude partial; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes

<p>You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.</p><p>If the subject of a <i>phantasmal killer</i> attack succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a <i>helm of telepathy,</i> the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.</p>
