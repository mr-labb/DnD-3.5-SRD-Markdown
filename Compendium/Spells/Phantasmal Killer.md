## Phantasmal Killer

Fearsome illusion kills subject or deals 3d6 damage.

### Spell Details

- **Level**: Sor/Wiz 4  
- **Components**: V, S  
- **Casting Time**: 1 standard action  
- **Range**: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
- **Effect**: One living creature

### Description

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast.  
Only the spell's subject can see the Phantasmal Killer. You see only a vague shape.  

The target first gets a **Will save** to recognize the image as unreal.  
If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a **Fortitude save** or **die from fear**.  
Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes **3d6 points of damage**.

If the subject of a Phantasmal Killer attack succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a Helm of Telepathy, the beast can be turned upon you.  
You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.
