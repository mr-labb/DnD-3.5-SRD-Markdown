You contact your deity—or agents thereof—and ask questions that can be answered with a simple **yes or no**. If the cleric has no specific deity, a philosophically aligned one may respond.

- You may ask **one question per caster level**.
- Answers are **correct within the entity's knowledge**.
- **“Unclear”** is a valid response; Outer Planar beings are not omniscient.
- If a one-word answer would be misleading or against the entity’s interests, a **short phrase (five words or less)** may be given instead.

Entities contacted generally structure answers to align with their **own purposes**.

> If you pause, deliberate, or become distracted during the spell’s duration, the connection **ends immediately**.

**Material Component:** Holy (or unholy) water and incense  
**XP Cost:** 100 XP
