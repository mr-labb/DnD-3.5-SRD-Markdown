If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.</p><p>Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet.</p><p>Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x5 feet.</p><p>Large or larger creatures may move normally within a <i>gust of wind</i> effect.</p><p>A <i>gust of wind</i> can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range.</p><p>Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a <i>gust of wind</i>.</p><p>The force of the <i>gust</i> automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.</p><p>In addition to the effects noted, a <i>gust of wind</i> can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do.
