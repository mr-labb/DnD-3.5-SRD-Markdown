## Command

One subject obeys selected command for 1 round.

* **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]  
* **Level:** Clr 1  
* **Components:** V  
* **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
* **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
* **Effect:** One living creature  
* **Duration:** 1 round  
* **Saving Throw:** Will negates  
* **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options:

- **Approach:** Subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. It does nothing else and provokes attacks of opportunity.
- **Drop:** Subject drops whatever it is holding and cannot pick it back up until its next turn.
- **Fall:** Subject falls prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but suffers appropriate penalties.
- **Flee:** Subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It does nothing else and provokes attacks of opportunity.
- **Halt:** Subject stands in place for 1 round. It takes no actions but is not considered helpless.

If the subject cannot carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.
