## Word of Chaos

Kills, confuses, stuns, or deafens nonchaotic subjects.

- **School:** Evocation [Chaotic, Sonic]  
- **Level:** Chaos 7, Clr 7  
- **Components:** V  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** 40 ft.  
- **Effect:** Nonchaotic creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates; see text  
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes  

Any nonchaotic creature within the area who hears the *word of chaos* suffers the following cumulative and concurrent effects. No saving throw is allowed against these unless specified:

- **Deafened:** For 1d4 rounds  
- **Stunned:** For 1 round  
- **Confused:** As by the *[[Confusion]]* spell, for 1d10 minutes (mind-affecting enchantment)  
- **Killed:** Living creatures die; undead creatures are destroyed  

### Effects by Hit Dice

| HD                            | Effect                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Equal to caster level        | Deafened                               |
| Up to caster level -1        | Stunned, deafened                      |
| Up to caster level -5        | *Confused*, stunned, deafened          |
| Up to caster level -10       | Killed, *confused*, stunned, deafened  |

If cast on your home plane, all **nonchaotic extraplanar creatures** within the area are **instantly banished** back to their home planes and cannot return for at least 24 hours. This happens regardless of whether the targets heard the *word of chaos*. This banishment allows a **Will save** (with a â€“4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by *word of chaos*.
