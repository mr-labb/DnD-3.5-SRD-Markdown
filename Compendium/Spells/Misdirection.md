### Description

You misdirect information from **divination spells that reveal auras** (e.g., [[Detect Evil]], [[Detect Magic]], [[Discern Lies]]).

- On casting, choose another object within range  
- For the spellâ€™s duration, the **subject is detected as if it were the other object**  
- Neither the subject nor the reference object gets a saving throw  
- Detection spells yield **results based on the second object**, unless the caster **succeeds on a Will save**

For example:
- You can make yourself detect as a nearby tree: **not evil**, **not magical**, **neutral**, etc.

**Limitations**:
- Does **not affect** other types of divination magic (e.g., [[Augury]], [[Detect Thoughts]], [[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance|Clairaudience/Clairvoyance]])
