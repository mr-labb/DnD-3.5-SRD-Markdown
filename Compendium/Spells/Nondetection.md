<p>The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object,</i> and <i>detect</i> spells. <i>Nondetection</i> also prevents location by such magic items as <i>crystal ball</i>s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <i>nondetection</i>. If you cast <i>nondetection</i> on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.</p><p>If cast on a creature, <i>nondetection</i> wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.</p>
