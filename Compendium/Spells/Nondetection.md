### Description

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as [[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance|Clairaudience/Clairvoyance]], [[Locate Object]], and Detect spells. *Nondetection* also prevents location via magic items like Crystal Ball's.

If a divination is attempted against the warded target, the caster must succeed on a **caster level check** (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of:
- **11 + your caster level**  
- If cast on yourself or on an item in your possession: **DC 15 + your caster level**

If cast on a creature, *Nondetection* wards both the creature and its gear.

### Material Component

A pinch of **diamond dust worth 50 gp**.
