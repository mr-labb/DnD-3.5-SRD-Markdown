## Description

This spell functions like *polymorph*, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration depends on how radical the change is, determined by the following duration factors:

### Duration Factor Table

- Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral): +5  
- Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.): +2  
- Same size: +2  
- Related (twig to tree, wolf fur to wolf): +2  
- Same or lower Intelligence: +2  

Add all applicable modifiers and consult the table below:

### Resulting Duration

- **0** → 20 minutes (e.g., Pebble to human)  
- **2** → 1 hour (e.g., Marionette to human)  
- **4** → 3 hours (e.g., Human to marionette)  
- **5** → 12 hours (e.g., Lizard to manticore)  
- **6** → 2 days (e.g., Sheep to wool coat)  
- **7** → 1 week (e.g., Shrew to manticore)  
- **9+** → Permanent (e.g., Manticore to shrew)  

Unlike *polymorph*, *Polymorph Any Object* grants the Intelligence score of the new form. If the original form lacked Wisdom or Charisma, the new form's scores are used.

Damage taken by the new form can injure or kill the polymorphed creature, especially through physical transformation.

This spell cannot:
- Create magical items from nonmagical ones  
- Affect magic items  
- Generate materials of intrinsic value (e.g., precious metals, gems, silk)  
- Mimic cold iron properties for overcoming damage reduction  

It can duplicate the effects of:  
*[[Baleful Polymorph]], [[Polymorph]], [[Flesh to Stone]], [[Stone to Flesh]], [[Transmute Mud to Rock]], [[Transmute Metal to Wood]], [[Transmute Rock to Mud]]*

## Arcane Material Component

Mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.
