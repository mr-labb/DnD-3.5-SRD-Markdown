This spell functions like <i>[[symbol of death]]</i>, except that each creature within the radius of a <i>symbol of pain</i> instead suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of pain</i> has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <i>symbol of pain</i> simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

<i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of pain</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a <i>symbol of pain</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for <i>symbol of pain</i>.</p><p><i>Material Component:</i> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.</p>
