## Destruction

Kills subject and destroys remains.

### Spell Details

- **School:** Necromancy [Death]  
- **Level:** Clr 7, Death 7  
- **Components:** V, S, F  
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action  
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
- **Effect:** One creature  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial

### Description

This spell instantly slays the subject and consumes its remains (but not its equipment and possessions) utterly.  
If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes **10d6 points of damage**.

The only way to restore life to a character who has failed to save against this spell is to use [[True Resurrection]],  
a carefully worded [[Wish]] spell followed by [[Resurrection]], or [[Miracle]].

### Focus

A special holy (or unholy) symbol of silver marked with verses of anathema (cost 500 gp).
