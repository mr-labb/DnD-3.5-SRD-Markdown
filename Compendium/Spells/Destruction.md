The only way to restore life to a character who has failed to save against this spell is to use <i>true resurrection</i>, a carefully worded <i>wish</i> spell followed by <i>resurrection</i>, or <i>miracle</i>.</p><p><i>Focus:</i> A special holy (or unholy) symbol of silver marked with verses of anathema (cost 500 gp).</p>
