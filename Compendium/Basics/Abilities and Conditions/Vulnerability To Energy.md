##### Vulnerability to Energy

Some creatures have vulnerability to a certain kind of energy effect (typically either cold or fire). 

Such a creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from the effect, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
