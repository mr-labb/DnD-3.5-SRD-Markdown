##### Frightened

A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.  
Frightened is like [[shaken]], except that the creature must flee if possible. [[Panicked]] is a more extreme state of fear.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
