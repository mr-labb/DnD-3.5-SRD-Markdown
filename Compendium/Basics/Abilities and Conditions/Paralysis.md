##### PARALYSIS [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]] or [[Special Abilities#|##### Supernatural Abilities (Su)|(Su)]]

Some monsters and spells have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze their victims, immobilizing them through magical means. (Paralysis from toxins is discussed in the [[Poison]] section)

A paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no components.

Paralysis works on the body, and a character can usually resist it with a Fortitude saving throw (the DC is given in the creature’s description). Unlike [[hold person]] and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new save each round.

A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.

**Extraordinary Abilities [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]]**: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.

**Supernatural Abilities [[Special Abilities#|##### Supernatural Abilities (Su)|(Su)]]**: Supernatural abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an antimagic field). A supernatural ability’s effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See the table below for a summary of the types of special abilities.
