##### Knocked Down

Depending on their size, creatures can be knocked down by winds of high velocity. Creatures on the ground are knocked [[prone]] by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6 x 10 feet.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
