##### RAY (Su or Sp)

This form of special attack works like a ranged attack. Hitting with a ray attack requires a successful ranged touch attack roll, ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield and using the creature’s ranged attack bonus. 

Rays have varying ranges, which are simple maximums. A ray’s attack roll never takes a range penalty. The creature’s descriptive text specifies the maximum range, effects, and any applicable saving throw.  

 Even if a ray hits, it usually allows the target to make a saving throw (Fortitude or Will). Rays never allow a Reflex saving throw, but if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC is high, it might be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.
