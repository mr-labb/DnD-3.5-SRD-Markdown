##### Deafened

A deafened character cannot hear. She takes a –4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails [[Listen]] checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
