##### Shaken

A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.  

Shaken is a less severe state of fear than [[frightened]] or [[panicked]].

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
