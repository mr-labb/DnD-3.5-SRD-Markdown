##### Flat-Footed

A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, not yet reacting normally to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects canâ€™t combine, apply the most severe effect.
