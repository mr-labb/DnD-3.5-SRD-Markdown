##### Ability Damaged

The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ability score points. Lost points return at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing the damage. A character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is [[helpless]]. A character with Dexterity 0 is [[paralyzed]]. A character with Constitution 0 is [[dead]]. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is [[unconscious]]. Ability damage is different from penalties to ability scores, which go away when the conditions causing them go away.  
Also see [[Ability Score Loss]]


**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects canâ€™t combine, apply the most severe effect.
