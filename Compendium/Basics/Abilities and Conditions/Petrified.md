##### Petrified

A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered [[unconscious]]. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
