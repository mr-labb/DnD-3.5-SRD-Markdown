##### Blown Away

Depending on its size, a creature can be blown away by winds of high velocity. A creature on the ground that is blown away is [[knocked down]] and rolls 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. A flying creature that is blown away is blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffering.


**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects canâ€™t combine, apply the most severe effect.
