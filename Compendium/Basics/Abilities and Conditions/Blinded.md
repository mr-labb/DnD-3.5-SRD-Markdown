###### Blinded

The character cannot see. He takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class, loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a –4 penalty on [[Search]] checks and on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and [[Spot]] checks) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) to the blinded character. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
