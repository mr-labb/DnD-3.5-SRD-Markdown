##### Entangled

The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or [[charge]], and takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a [[Concentration]] check (DC 15 + the spell’s level) or lose the spell.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
