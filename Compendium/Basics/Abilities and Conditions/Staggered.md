##### Staggered

A character whose nonlethal damage exactly equals his current hit points is staggered. A staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can she take full-round actions).

A character whose current hit points exceed his nonlethal damage is no longer staggered; a character whose nonlethal damage exceeds his hit points becomes [[unconscious]].

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
