##### Invisible

Visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents, and ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (See [[Invisibility]], under Special Abilities.)

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
