##### Paralyzed

A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is [[helpless]], but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown. An creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
