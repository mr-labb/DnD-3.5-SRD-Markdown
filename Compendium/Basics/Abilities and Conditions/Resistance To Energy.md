##### RESISTANCE TO ENERGY [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]]

A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain type  each round, but it does not have total immunity.

Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type (commonly acid, cold, fire, or electricity) it resists and how many points of damage are resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.

When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell. This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spell might provide.
