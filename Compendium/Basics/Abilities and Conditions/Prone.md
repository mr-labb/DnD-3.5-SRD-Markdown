##### Prone

The character is on the ground. 

An attacker who is prone has a –4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). 

A defender who is prone gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.  

Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
