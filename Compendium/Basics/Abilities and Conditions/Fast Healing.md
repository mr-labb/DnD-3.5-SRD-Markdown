##### FAST HEALING [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]]

A creature with fast healing has the extraordinary ability to regain hit points at an exceptional rate. Except for what is noted here, fast healing is like natural healing.

At the beginning of each of the creature’s turns, it heals a certain number of hit points (defined in its description).

Unlike [[regeneration]], fast healing does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals the nonlethal damage first.

Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.

Fast healing does not increase the number of hit points regained when a creature polymorphs.


**Extraordinary Abilities [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]]**: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.
