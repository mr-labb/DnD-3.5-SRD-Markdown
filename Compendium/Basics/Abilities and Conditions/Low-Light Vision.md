##### LOW-LIGHT VISION [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]]

Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. 



A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light.

Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.

It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.


**Extraordinary Abilities [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]]**: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.
