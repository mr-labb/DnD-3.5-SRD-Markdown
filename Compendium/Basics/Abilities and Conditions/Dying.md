##### Dying

A dying character is [[unconscious]] and near death. She has –1 to –9 current hit points. A dying character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10% chance to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying character reaches –10 hit points, she is dead.


**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
