##### Exhausted

An exhausted character moves at half speed and takes a –6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes [[fatigued]]. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
