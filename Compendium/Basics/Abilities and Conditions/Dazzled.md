##### Dazzled

The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, [[Search]] checks, and [[Spot]] checks.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
