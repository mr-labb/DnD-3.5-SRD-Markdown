##### DEATH ATTACKS

In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save to avoid the affect, but if the save fails, the character dies instantly.

- [[Raise dead]] doesn’t work on someone killed by a death attack.
    
- Death attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept alive.
    
- In case it matters, a dead character, no matter how she died, has –10 hit points.
    
- The spell [[death ward]] protects a character against these attacks.
