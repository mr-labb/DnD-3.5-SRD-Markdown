##### PSIONICS [[Special Abilities#|##### Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)|(Sp)]]



Telepathy, mental combat and psychic powers — psionics is a catchall word that describes special mental abilities possessed by various creatures. 

These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates from the power of its mind alone — no other outside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s description contains details on its psionic abilities.

Psionic attacks almost always allow Will saving throws to resist them. However, not all psionic attacks are mental attacks. Some psionic abilities allow the psionic creature to reshape its own body, heal its wounds, or teleport great distances. Some psionic creatures can see into the future, the past, and the present (in far-off locales) as well as read the minds of others.


**Spell-Like Abilities [[Special Abilities#|##### Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)|(Sp)]]**: Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are spells and magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and [[dispel magic]]. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an [[antimagic field]]).
