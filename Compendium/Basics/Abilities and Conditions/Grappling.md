##### Grappling

Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers. A grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does not threaten any squares, and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against opponents he isn’t grappling.  
Also see the [[grapple]] rules.  

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
