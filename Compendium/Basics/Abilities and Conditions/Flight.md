##### Flight [[Special Abilities#Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)|(Ex)]] or [[Special Abilities#|##### Supernatural Abilities (Su)|(Su)]]

A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If the ability is supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the creature loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists.
