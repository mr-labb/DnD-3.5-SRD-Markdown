##### Fatigued

A fatigued character can neither run nor [[charge]] and takes a –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become [[exhausted]]. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.

**If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most severe effect.
