### SORCERER

<br><br>Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no mentors, no theories - just raw power that they direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons courses through their veins. That claim may even be true in some cases - it is common [[Knowledge]] that certain powerful dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers, and it's difficult to prove that a given sorcerer does not have a dragon ancestor. It's true that sorcerers often have striking good looks, usually with a touch of the exotic that hints at an unusual heritage. Others hold that the claim is either an unsubstantiated boast on the part of certain sorcerers or envious gossip on the part of those who lack the sorcerer's gift.<br><br>The typical sorcerer adventures in order to improve his abilities. Only by testing his limits can he expand them. A sorcerer's power is inborn - part of his soul. Developing this power is a quest in itself for many sorcerers, regardless of how they wish to use their power. Some good sorcerers are driven by the need to prove themselves. Marked as different by their power, they seek to win a place in society and to prove themselves to others. Evil sorcerers, however, also feel themselves set apart from others - apart and above. They adventure to gain power over those they look down upon.<br><br>Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire powerful spells more slowly than wizards, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Sorcerers do not specialize in certain schools of magic the way wizards sometimes do. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they don't have the background of arcane [[Knowledge]] than most wizards have. However, they do have more time to learn fighting skills, and they are proficient with simple weapons.<br><br>For a sorcerer, magic is an intuitive art, not a science. Sorcery favors the free, chaotic, creative spirit over the disciplined mind, so sorcerers tend slightly toward chaos over law.<br><br>Some sorcerers favor Boccob (god of magic), while others revere Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic). However, many sorcerers follow some other deity, or none at all. (Wizards typically learn to follow Boccob or Wee Jas from their mentors, but most sorcerers are self-taught, with no master to induct them into a religion).<br><br>Sorcerers develop rudimentary powers at puberty. Their first spells are incomplete, spontaneous, uncontrolled, and sometimes dangerous. A household with a budding sorcerer in it may be troubled by strange sounds or lights, which can create the impression that the place is haunted. Eventually, the young sorcerer understands the power that he has been wielding unintentionally. From that point on, he can begin practicing and improving his powers. Sometimes a sorcerer is fortunate enough to come under the care of an older, more experienced sorcerer, someone who can help him understand and use his new powers. More often, however, sorcerers are on their own, feared by erstwhile friends and misunderstood by family. Sorcerers have no sense of identity as a group. Unlike wizards, they gain little by sharing their [[Knowledge]] and have no strong incentive to work together.<br><br>Most sorcerers are humans or half-elves, but the innate talent for sorcery is unpredictable, and it can show up in any of the common races. Arcane spellcasters from savage lands or from among the brutal humanoids are more likely to be sorcerers than wizards. Kobolds are especially likely to take up this path, and they are fierce, if inarticulate, proponents of the "blood of the dragons" theory.<br><br>Sorcerers find that they have the most in common with members of other largely self-taught classes, such as druids and rogues. They sometimes find themselves at odds with members of the more disciplined classes, such as paladins and monks. Since they cast the same spells as wizards but do so in a different way, they sometimes find themselves in competition with wizards.<br><br>A sorcerer tends to define his role based on his spell selection. A sorcerer who focuses on damage-dealing spells becomes a center of the party's offensive power. Another may rely on more subtle magics, such as charms and illusions, and thus take a quieter role. A party with a sorcerer should strongly consider including a second spellcaster, such as a bard, cleric, druid, or even a wizard, to make up for the sorcerer's lack of versatility. Since a sorcerer often has a powerful presence that gives him a way with people, he may serve as the "face" for an adventuring party, negotiating, bargaining, and speaking for others. The sorcerer's spells often help him sway others or gain information, so he makes an excellent spy or diplomat for an adventuring party.|

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the [[Wizard Spell List|sorcerer/wizard spell list]]. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).

To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.

A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.

**Familiar**: A sorcerer can obtain a [[familiar]]. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.

The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

#### Aligned Spellcaster

Your passions drive your magical abilities, imbuing your every spell with the power of your conviction. Those who oppose your ideals suffer the most from your magical energy.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Choose an alignment component you have that is not neutral. Spells you cast gain the apropriate alignment descriptor unless they already have the opposite alignment descriptor. For example, a neutral good wizard who selects this ability (and who must choose good) casts all spells that aren't evil spells as good spells.

Spells you cast that target creatures of the opposite alignment are cast at +1 caster level (+2 if they have the opposite alignment as a subtype). Area of effect and other spells that affect such creatures without targeting them do not gain this bonus. A neutral spellcaster gains no benefit from this ability.

#### Arcane Reabsorption

You have always focused more on the raw manipulation of arcane energy than others of your profession. As such, you know how to possibly regain that energy when outside forces attempt to disrupt your magic.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Whenever a targeted spell you cast fails to penetrate a creature's spell resistance or is countered by another spellcaster, you can immediately attempt to reabsorb the arcane energy you just spent as an immediate action. The spell can have no effect at all in order to use this ability. By making a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + [spell level × 3]), you regain the spell as if it was never cast (or regain the spell slot if you cast spells spontaneously). Attempting this taxes your body. Regardless of the success of the check, you take 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level you attempt to reabsorb. This damage is internal and bypasses damage reduction and resistances you possess.



#### Battle Sorcerer

The battle sorcerer is no weak arcanist, hiding behind the fighters. Instead, she is a capable physical combatant who mixes magical prowess with fighting skill.

**Hit Die**: d8.

**Base Attack Bonus**: The battle sorcerer uses the base attack bonus progression of the [[Cleric]].

##### Class Skills

Remove [[Bluff]] from the battle sorcerer's class skill list. Add [[Intimidate]] to the battle sorcerer's class skill list.

##### Class Features

The battle sorcerer has all the standard sorcerer class features, except as noted below.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: At 1st level, a battle sorcerer gains proficiency with any light or one-handed martial weapon of the character's choice. She also gains proficiency with [[light armor]].

**Spellcasting**: A battle sorcerer can cast sorcerer spells derived from her class levels of battle sorcerer while in light armor without the normal arcane spell failure chance.

A battle sorcerer has fewer daily spell slots than a standard sorcerer. Subtract one spell per day from each spell level on Table: The Sorcerer (to a minimum of zero spells per day). For example, a 1st-level battle sorcerer may cast four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells per day (plus bonus spells, if any).

A battle sorcerer knows fewer spells per spell level than a standard sorcerer. Subtract one spell known from each spell level on Table: [[#Sorcerer Spells Known]] (to a minimum of one spell per spell level). For example, a 4th-level battle sorcerer knows five 0-level spells, two 1st-level spells, and one 2nd-level spell. When she reaches 5th level, the battle sorcerer learns one additional 1st-level spell, but doesn't learn an additional 2nd-level spell (since two minus one is one).

#### Beleaguered Spellcaster

The most fragile of all archetypes, arcane spellcasters struggle to avoid taking damage as often as possible. As injuries accumulate your desperation causes your spells to become more effective.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Whenever you take an amount of damage equal to 3 times your spellcaster level from one attack, the next spell you cast is automatically maximized or extended (your choice) without increasing the spell level or casting time.

You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + the spellcasting ability score modifier of the class in which you took this alternative class feature.

#### Blood of Eberron

You possess a deep bond to Eberron, the Dragon Between, which shapes your sorcerous powers. Myths call Eberron the mother of all natural creatures, giving you a deep bond to the world of nature.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the normal list of class skills, nor do you gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: The following are your sorcerer class skills: Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Heal, [[Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge]] (nature), Profession, Spellcraft.

In addition, you gain an animal companion, as a druid of half your sorcerer level. Your druid, ranger, and sorcerer levels stack to determine the abilities of your animal companion. If you possess the Natural Spell feat, its benefits apply any time that you are in the form of an animal, whether due to wild shape, polymorph, or other magical effects.

#### Blood of Khyber

You possess a deep bond to Khyber, the Dragon Below, which shapes your sorcerous powers. Your bond with the darkness increases your ability to conjure fiendish creatures and work spells of transmutation.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replace**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the normal list of class skills, nor do you gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: The following are your sorcerer class skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft, Intimidate, [[Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge]] (dungeoneering), Profession, Spellcraft.

Your caster level increases by 1 whenever you cast spells from the schools of conjuration (summoning) or transmutation. You cannot summon any creature of good alignment. In addition, your caster level decreases by 1 (minimum CL 1st) whenever you cast spells from the schools of abjuration or divination.

#### Blood of Siberys

You possess a deep bond to Siberys, the Dragon Above, which shapes your sorcerous powers. Many believe the Dragon Above is the source of all arcane magic, and the first dragons were born from the blood that fell when Khyber slew Siberys. Your bond to the Dragon Above enhances your ability to channel magic.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the normal list of class skills, nor do you gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: The following are your sorcerer class skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, [[Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge]] (the planes), Profession, Spellcraft.

In addition, you add +4 to your effective Charisma for purposes of determining bonus sorcerer spells and the maximum level of spell you can cast. For example, even if your natural Charisma is 14, you can still cast up to 8th-level sorcerer spells. This bonus does not affect saving throw DCs, skill rolls, or provide any of the other benefits dependant on Charisma.

#### Dead Levels

The sorcerer, similar to the cleric, has nineteen dead levels. The sorcerer parts from the cleric, however, in that new spells known are gained at every level (which can be considered special abilities in their own right). Still, a prestige class that grants +1 level of spellcasting and special abilities at every level makes a minor dead level ability infinitely possible.

**Magical Affinity (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a sorcerer can identify a certain creature type during an encounter by virtue of inheriting his magical ability from a member of that creature type. The type must include at least one creature with an arcane spell-like ability (such as dragon, magical beast, or outsider). Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. The sorcerer gains a +2 bonus on [[Knowledge]] (arcana) checks to identify such creature types, but he gains no insight about their special powers or vulnerabilities. See [[Knowledge]]. Moreover, the sorcerer can make these [[Knowledge]] (arcana) checks untrained. This bonus increases by +1 for each sorcerer level the character takes after 2nd level.

#### Disciple of Boccob

As a deeply loyal and pious student of Boccob the Uncaring, you know the secret to creating powerful magic items through your understanding of the Archmage of the Deities' teachings.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: You qualify for item creation feats as a character 1 level higher. Magic items you create are crafted at +1 caster level. The item gains this bonus for free; you do not pay the extra cost associated with a higher caster level. If you destroy a permanent magic item you lose all arcane spellcasting abilities for a day per caster level of the item.

#### Divine Companion

By sacrificing a possible link to an earthly creature, you gain the ability to store arcane energy in a divine reservoir that takes the form of a spirit creature. Linked to you through your own life essence, this divine companion can then transform that energy into beneficial effects.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the summon familiar class feature.

**Benefit**: You can spend 100 gp to perform a ritual dedicated to the deity of your choice and summon forth a spirit creature to aid you in your adventures. This creature is both invisible and intangible, but it provides you with real benefits.

The divine companion stores arcane energy and redirects it to you according to your level and your needs. To fill this reservoir, you must cast one or more targeted spells at this creature. A spell so cast does not produce its normal effect; the companion simply absorbs the spell's energy. It can store a number of spell levels equal to your arcane caster level. You can cast spells into it at any time, but after you rest and recover your spell slots for the day, the divine companion loses any stored energy.

The divine companion exists outside reality and cannot be affected by spells, spell-like abilities, or any sort of antimagic effect or dispel check. It cannot, however, release its arcane energy within an antimagk field or similar effect. It uses your caster level for any checks required, and when it releases arcane energy, the level of the effect created equals the number of spell levels released.

The divine companion can release its stored spell energy in either of the following ways, at your command. You can use each effect as often as you wish, until the companion's stored energy is depleted.

_Healing (Su)_: As a standard action, you can order your divine companion to convert the energy it has stored into healing power. This is the equivalent of a conjuration (healing) spell. This effect heals you for 1d6 points of damage per stored spell level, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored).

_Shielding (Su)_: As a swift action, you can order the creature to convert the energy it has stored into protecting you. This is the equivalent of an abjuration spell that provides you with a deflection bonus to AC and a resistance bonus on saves each equal to the number of stored spell levels, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). This effect lasts for 1 round per arcane caster level you possess.

#### Domain Access

Your depth of belief allows you to channel divine power the way a cleric does. By doing so, you gain access to a single cleric domain.

**Level**: 5th.

**Replaces**: To gain this benefit, you do not learn a new 1st-level sorcerer spell and a new 2nd-level sorcerer spell at 5th level. From now on, you know one less sorcerer spell that you can cast at each subsequent level (not counting the domain spells from this alternative class feature).

**Benefit**: Choose one cleric domain. If you worship a specific deity, the domain you choose must be one to which your deity grants access. You gain the granted power of the chosen domain. In addition, you can cast one domain spell of each spell level available to you per day from that domain.

#### Draconic Ray

The silver-haired ice mage and the black-eyed scoundrel with a knack for corrosive spells belong to a unique breed of sorcerers. Their personalities, physical traits, and the spells at which they excel reflect their draconic heritages.

These sorcerers explore the roots of sorcery and develop alternative class features based on the nature of their draconic ancestors. If the sorcerer gains draconic ray, he must choose a specific ancestral dragon kind from among the various breeds of chromatic and metallic dragons. The sorcerer must select his ancestral dragon kind when he acquires his first level in sorcerer. Once chosen, he may not change it later. A sorcerer who selects this alternative class feature permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar. Since this is an optional rule, you must check with your DM before selecting draconic ray in place of a familiar.

If you take draconic ray and the Draconic Heritage feat, you must choose the same dragon kind for both.

**Draconic Ray (Su)**: The sorcerer can, once per day, fire a ray as a spell-like ability. Using this ray requires a successful ranged touch attack. A creature struck by such a ray takes 1d4 points of damage + 1 per sorcerer level of an energy type appropriate to the sorcerer's chosen dragon ancestor kind. In addition, the creature struck by the ray must make a saving throw of the appropriate type (DC 10 + 1 per 2 sorcerer levels + Charisma modifier) or also be affected by the ray's secondary effect. Each ray has a range of 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 sorcerer levels. The type of energy damage dealt and the ray's secondary effect depends on the chosen ancestor dragon. The caster level for secondary effects equals half the character's sorcerer levels.

|Ancestor  <br>Dragon|Energy  <br>Type|Secondary  <br>Effect|Saving  <br>Throw|
|---|---|---|---|
|Black|Acid|Shadow eyes|Will|
|Blue|Electricity|Dehydration|Fortitude|
|Green|Acid|Command|Will|
|Red|Fire|Burning|Reflex|
|White|Cold|Rime of ice|Reflex|
|Brass|Fire|Sleep|Will|
|Bronze|Electricity|Fear|Will|
|Copper|Acid|Slow|Fortitude|
|Gold|Fire|Weakening|Fortitude|
|Silver|Cold|Hold Person|Will|

_Burning_: The target [[catches on fire]] unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. This deals 1d4 points of damage per round for 1 round per 2 sorcerer levels.

_Command_: The target is affected by the command spell unless it succeeds at a Will save.

_Dehydration_: The target is dehydrated and must succeed at a Fort save or take an additional 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 2 sorcerer levels.

_Fear_: The target becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save.

_Hold Person_: The target is held, as hold person, for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save.

_Rime of Ice_: The target is covered in a rime of ice that lasts 1 round. If the target fails on a Reflex save it drops whatever it is holding and falls prone.

_Shadow Eyes_: Shadows shroud the target's eyes for 1d6 rounds, causing everything to have concealment in relation to the target (a 20% miss chance). Creatures with blindsight or other abilities to perceive their surroundings without using their eyes can ignore this effect.

_Sleep_: The target falls asleep for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save.

_Slow_: The target is slowed for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.

_Weakening_: The target takes a 1d4 penalty to Strength unless it succeeds at a Fort save. This penalty lasts for 1 round per two sorcerer levels of the sorcerer.

#### Dragonblood Sorcerer

Kobolds, spellscales, and the members of other dragonblood races tap into their innate draconic talents to achieve greater heights of sorcerous power. Forgoing any pretense of mundane pursuits, a dragonblood sorcerer explores new approaches to casting arcane spells.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a dragonblood sorcerer substitution level, a character must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to take his 1st, 4th, or 7th level of sorcerer.

##### Class Skills

Dragonblood sorcerer substitution levels have the class skills of the standard sorcerer class, minus Craft and Profession, plus Use Magic Device. In addition, a dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains a class skill from his Draconic Heritage feat.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the dragonblood sorcerer racial substitution levels.

**Arcane Insight (Ex)**: A 1st-level dragonblood sorcerer's racial talent with magic grants him keen insights into arcane mysteries. Each time he selects a dragonblood sorcerer substitution level, he gains a cumulative +2 insight bonus on [[Knowledge]] (arcana) checks.

**Draconic Heritage**: A 1st-level dragonblood sorcerer gains Draconic Heritage as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer's familiar class feature.

**Spell-Like Ability**: A dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to transform a sorcerer spell he knows into a spell-like ability. A spell chosen for this ability can't have a costly material component, an XP cost, or any sort of focus, and it can't be a spell of the highest level the sorcerer can cast. The chosen spell is removed from the sorcerer's list of spells known, reducing his number of known spells of that level by one, and the sorcerer loses one spell slot of that spell level - as well as one spell slot from the next higher level of spells he is able to cast. In return for those two spell slots, he gains the ability to use the chosen spell as a spell-like ability three times per day, using his sorcerer level as the caster level.

Each time a dragonblood sorcerer who has this substitution level feature gains access to a new spell level, he can exchange the spell chosen for this ability for a new one. He returns the previously chosen spell to his list of spells known and regains both lost spell slots. He then chooses a new spell, subject to the limitations given above. He loses that spell from his spells known list along with one spell slot of the newly chosen spell's level and a spell slot one level higher than the chosen spell.

**Bonus Spells Known**: A dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level adds four spells to his list of known sorcerer spells. The spells added depend on the dragonblood sorcerer's alignment or draconic heritage.

A dragonblood sorcerer who is good-aligned must choose the good list of known spells, and vice versa. One descended from a particular kind of dragon is treated as if he shared that dragon's alignment for the purpose of this substitution feature, regardless of his own alignment. For example, a half-red dragon sorcerer, or a sorcerer with Draconic Heritage (red dragon), is treated as evil-aligned for determining which bonus spells known he gains. Dragonblood sorcerers who are neither good nor evil and have no distinct draconic heritage can choose which set of spells to add.

If a dragonblood sorcerer already knows any of the listed spells, he can pick another spell that a sorcerer would ordinarily have available at that same level.

_Evil_: 1st - charm person; 2nd - darkness, resist energy; 3rd - suggestion.

_Good_: 1st - bless; 2nd - fog cloud, resist energy; 3rd - fly.

The chosen list of spells known replaces the normal additions to the sorcerer's list of spells known (one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, one 3rd-level spell) gained at 7th level.

#### Drakken Familiar

Arcane spellcasters, even those who don't claim the blood of dragons as their own, often have a special link with dragonkind. One manifestation of this link is the caster's familiar, which can take on draconic characteristics.

**Class**: Hexblade, sorcerer, or wizard.

**Level**: 4th (hexblade) or 1st (sorcerer or wizard).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, your familiar does not gain all the benefits normally accorded to a familiar. See below to determine which alternative benefits it gains, and which standard benefits these replace.

**Benefit**: Your familiar is a drakken version of a normal animal. It gains the dragonblood subtype and all the benefits of being a familiar, except as described below.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to deliver touch spells, it gains a breath weapon instead. This breath is a 15-foot cone of fire, usable once per hour, that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + twice your class level (levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for this purpose). A successful Reflex save (10 + 1/2 your total class levels for determining the familiar's abilities) halves the damage dealt.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to speak with animals of its kind, it instead gains the ability to speak with creatures of the dragon type.

#### Dwarf Sorcerer

In most dwarf communities, sorcerers are relatively rare. Dwarves don't tend to have the force of personality required for top-notch sorcerers; thus they often prefer wizardry instead. However, a dwarf sorcerer can tap into other reservoirs of power - including the very earth itself - to enhance his arcane aptitude. To do this, he gives up some of his versatility, but the power gained is substantial.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a dwarf sorcerer substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take his 1st, 5th, or 9th level of sorcerer.

##### Class Skills

Dwarf sorcerer substitution levels have the class skills of the standard sorcerer class plus [[Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Dwarf Sorcerer Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+0|+2|Arcane earthbond|Same as sorcerer|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Power of stone|See text|
|9th|+4|+3|+3|+6|Earth meditation|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the dwarf sorcerer's racial substitution levels.

**Arcane Earthbond (Su)**: A dwarf sorcerer who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can draw power and support from an arcane bond he forges with the earth. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magic materials that cost 100 gp.

The arcane earthbond ability grants a dwarf sorcerer the Alertness feat whenever he is in contact with the ground. He also enjoys damage reduction 1/adamantine when in contact with the ground.

This benefit replaces the standard sorcerer's ability to gain a familiar. If the dwarf gains a familiar from another class (such as wizard), his sorcerer levels don't stack to determine the familiar's abilities.

**Power of Stone (Su)**: A dwarf sorcerer who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level learns to channel his spell power through the earth. As long as both he and his target are touching the ground, the range of any spell he casts that targets or affects that creature or object is increased by 50%, and the save DC for the spell increases by 1. If the spell targets multiple creatures or objects, all the targets must be touching the ground for the sorcerer to gain the benefits of this ability.

This benefit replaces the standard sorcerer's ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell at 5th level. From now on, the dwarf sorcerer's number of 2nd-level spells known is one fewer than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

**Earth Meditation (Ex)**: A dwarf sorcerer who takes the 9th-level racial substitution level learns to focus his meditations on the quiet power of the earth beneath him. If the dwarf sorcerer spends his 8 hours of rest and 15 minutes of concentration to prepare spells while in contact with the ground, he can add his Constitution bonus (if any) to his Charisma score to determine his bonus sorcerer spell slots.

This benefit replaces the standard sorcerer's ability to learn a new 4th-level spell at 9th level. From now on, the dwarf sorcerer's number of 4th-level spells known is one fewer than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

#### Focus Caster

A familiar offers companionship and, when necessary, an effective scout or spy. It does little for your spellcasting, however. This option presents you with a less generally useful item that instead enhances your spellcasting in some way.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Instead of a familiar, you bind yourself to a masterwork item that acts as a focus for all your spells and that enhances the power of spells of one school. Once you have a masterwork item to bind to, you must perform a ritual that requires 24 hours and reagents costing 100 gp, much as if you were summoning a familiar.

When casting any spell, you must hold, wield, or wear this item (as appropriate), in addition to providing the normal components of the spell (even other foci). Your focus item is used in addition to the spell's normal components, not instead of. You are automatically considered proficient with your focus item, but you do not gain proficiency with any other item (weapon or armor) of the same type. For example, if your focus item is a longsword, you are proficient with your focus longsword but not with any other longsword, unless of course another feat or class feature grants you proficiency. When you cast a spell from the school to which your focus belongs, that spell is enhanced. At 7th and 15th levels, your focus grants additional abilities.

You may have only one focus item at a time. A specialist wizard may select only the focus appropriate to her specialty school. Bonuses gained from a focus item stack with similar bonuses gained from feats such as Spell Focus or Spell Penetration.

Your focus item grows tougher as you advance in level. The hardness of your focus item increases by one-half your caster level, up to double its normal hardness. In addition, your focus item gains additional hit points equal to your caster level, up to double its normal number of hit points. These bonuses are in addition to any increase in hardness or hit points the item gains for being made into a magic item.

If your focus item can be enhanced with magic, it costs you less XP to do so. When determining your XP cost for making your focus item into a magic item (or for upgrading it later), reduce the base cost by 10%. This reduction stacks with any other reduction you might gain, such as from the Legendary Artisan feat. Another character enhancing your focus item does not gain this reduction in XP cost.

If your focus item is destroyed, you must bind yourself to another masterwork item. You cannot bind to an item that is already a magic item. You can only bind to masterwork items. The item can be made of special materials (such as adamantine, cold iron, or darkwood).

The following items are typical foci for each of the standard schools.

_Abjuration_: Usually a set of bracers, a buckler, or a small shield (wooden or steel), your focus grants any nonpersonal abjuration spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, you may cast any personal abjuration spell as a touch spell.

_Conjuration_: Usually a gnarled and twisted quarterstaff or other polearm, your focus increases the duration of any conjuration spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 3 rounds.

_Divination_: Usually a large crystal (loose or mounted on a rod or staff) or ornate holy symbol, your focus increases the caster level of any divination spell you cast by +1. At 7th level, the duration of any divination spell you cast doubles. At 15th level, you gain a bonus to resist divinations equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).

_Enchantment_: Usually an ornate and typically nonfunctional piece of clothing, such as a sash or a hair ribbon, your focus increases the duration of any enchantment spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the DC of your enchantment spells increases by +2.

_Evocation_: Usually a bladed weapon, such as a longsword or dagger, your focus grants +1 point of damage to any evocation spell you cast. Non-area effect spells that allow multiple targets (such as magic missile) only deal the bonus damage to a single target of your choice. For example, a fireball spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer with this focus deals 6d6+1 points of damage to all creatures caught within it, while a magic missile spell cast by the same sorcerer creates three missiles: two that deal 1d4+1 points of damage and one that deals 1d4+2 points of damage. At 7th level, evocation spells you cast ignore the first 5 points of any energy or elemental resistances that a creature may have. Immunities are not affected. At 15th level, you may, once per day, ignore a creature's immunity when you cast an evocation spell that affects it.

_Illusion_: Usually a mask, shroud, cloak, or similar concealing piece of clothing, your focus increases the caster level of illusion spells you cast by +1. At 7th level, for every illusion spell you cast you gain a bonus on caster level checks made to defeat spell resistance equal to half your caster level. At 15th level, you may cast any personal illusion spell as a touch spell.

_Necromancy_: Usually a flail, kama, sickle, scythe, or other weapon derived from harvesting crops, your focus increases the range of any necromancy spell you cast by +25%. At 7th level, any necromancy spell you cast that deals ability damage, ability drain, or directly assigns a penally to an ability score deals +1 point of ability damage or ability drain or increases the penalty by an additional -1. For example, a 12th-level necromancer who casts ray of enfeeblement bestows a Strength penalty of 1d6+6 instead of the normal 1d6+5. At 15th level, any living creature affected by a necromancy spell you cast and fails the Fortitude save against it also becomes fatigued.

_Transmutation_: Usually a piece of equipment or set of tools used to create something (such as thieves' tools, a musical instrument, or artisan's tools), your focus grants any nonpersonal transmutation spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, once per day, a transmutation spell you cast that grants a bonus to ability scores doubles the bonus. For example, a bull's strength spell grants a +8 bonus to Strength instead of the normal +4.

#### Githyanki Sorcerer

As arcane spellcasters, sorcerers belong to the warlock caste. Though sorcerers fill the same role as wizards, the githyanki view them as a completely different kind of spellcaster. As a society that pays careful attention to function and performance, the githyanki recognize the flexibility of sorcerers' casting as a great advantage, while likewise recognizing the severe limitations of their constrained spell selection. Unlike most other races, the githyanki rarely send a sorcerer to do a wizard's job, or vice versa. They value sorcerers for combat-heavy missions, where the best tactic is likely to involve blasting the enemy with lightning bolt after lightning bolt.

Like sorcerers among other races, githyanki sorcerers trace their power to dragon ancestry; specifically, to the same interbreeding of githyanki and fiendish red dragons that produced the first duthka'gith. Githyanki sorcerers often manifest monstrous features, largely cosmetic, reminiscent of their infernal draconic heritage.

Sorcerers who choose the path of the duthka'ariy manifest their draconic heritage as they advance levels, but they can never acquire a familiar. A sorcerer of the duthka'ariy gains the following benefits as he advances in level:

|Sorcerer  <br>Level|Duthka'ariy Abilities|
|---|---|
|1st–4th|_Natural Weapons_: The character gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.  <br>_Keen Senses_: The character gains the benefit of the Alertness feat.|
|5th–8th|_Natural Armor_: The character gains a natural armor bonus of +1.|
|9th–12th|_Keen Senses_: The character's darkvision extends to 120 feet.|
|13th–16th|_Fire Focus_: The character casts fire spells at +1 caster level.|
|17th–20th|_Fire Resistance_: The character gains fire resistance 10.|

  

#### Golarion Sorcerer

Some sorcerers raised on the Isle of Hermea do not call familiars like others from the mainland. They instead focus their development on harnessing their inner reserve of magic, for use in times of need. This ability replaces the summon familiar ability.

**Hidden Reserve (Su)**: Starting at 1st level, a sorcerer with this ability can call upon a hidden reserve of magical energy to cast additional spells. This reserve can be used to cast any spell the sorcerer could normally cast, but the sorcerer is fatigued after the spell is completed. If this spell if of the highest level that the sorcerer could normally cast, the sorcerer is exhausted instead. This ability cannot be used while fatigued or exhausted. It can be used a number of times per day equal to the sorcerer's Charisma bonus.

#### Imbued Staff

As an optional rule, any sorcerer or wizard may opt to forego a normal familiar in order to imbue her traveling staff with that portion of her power. To do this, she selects a quarterstaff-length of wood that resonates with her mystical signature and personality. It cannot have been previously enchanted (although it may subsequently be) and must be of masterwork quality. It must be prepared using materials costing at least 500 gp, usually with a gem to serve as a mounted finial. The imbuing ritual takes 24 hours and ties a portion of the spellcaster's power into the staff, a separate piece of her soul that grows in power as she does. Upon its imbuing, the staff becomes magically linked to its creator and is treated as a magic item.

**Hit Points**: The staff has 10 Hit Points and Hardness 5, both of which increase as the wizard or sorcerer gains levels, according to the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

**Saving Throws**: The staff saves as its creator, even when unattended.

If an imbued staff is broken, its creator must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or lose 500 experience points per wizard or sorcerer level. Success reduces the loss by half. However, a caster's experience point total can never be reduced below 0 as a result of the loss of her staff. A broken imbued staff cannot be replaced for a year and a day - the loss is too great.

If the character who imbued the staff dies, the staff loses all magical properties. Should the character return from the grave, it regains its imbued powers when it is first touched by the imbuing character.

**Table: Imbued Staff Advancement**

|Master  <br>Class Level|Hardness|Hit Points|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st–2nd|5|15|Cantrips, deliver touch spells|
|3rd–4th|5|15|Enhanced weapon +1|
|5th–6th|5|15|Remote viewing|
|7th–8th|10|20|—|
|9th–10th|10|20|Vital Transfer|
|11th–12th|10|20|Enhanced weapon +2|
|13th–14th|15|25|Perfect location|
|15th–16th|15|25|Mighty weapon|
|17th–18th|15|25|Return|
|19th–20th|20|30|Enhanced weapon +3|

##### Imbued Ability Descriptions

An imbued staff has special capabilities depending on its master's wizard or sorcerer level, as shown on the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

**Cantrips (Sp)**: Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder of the staff can make it shed a flickering light as per the spell. Once activated, this light remains until the wielder dismisses it (a free action). In addition, the staff can hold a single cantrip available to the wielder, decided upon when it is first imbued. Once per day, as a standard action, the master can cast this cantrip from the staff. The caster level for these effects is equal to that of the master. The save DC for any cantrip cast by the staff is 10.

**Deliver Touch Spells (Su)**: The master may deliver touch spells with the staff. When using the staff in this way, the wielder may attempt to deal the staffs damage by hitting the target's standard AC (as opposed to the target's touch AC). A successful critical hit with the staff does not double the spell's affect when delivered in this way.

**Enhanced Weapon (Su)**: The staff gains the listed enhancement bonus to attack and damage when wielded by its master. This bonus applies to both ends of the staff. In the hands of any other it is merely an ordinary masterwork staff.

**Remote Viewing (Su)**: The staff's master may concentrate and view the staff's surroundings as though looking through the finial. This effect is identical to that of clairvoyance except that it lasts for as long as the owner concentrates and has an infinite range so long as the staff is on the same plane. While in effect, the staff's finial glows faintly, illuminating the area around the staff like a candle.

**Vital Transfer (Su)**: The staff's master may opt to forego her natural healing for the evening and mend her staff through mystical means. Each night's rest thus spent returns a number of hit points to the staff equal to the master's character level, up to the staff's maximum hit points. The Heal skill does not increase this amount.

**Perfect Location (Su)**: By concentrating for a full round, the wizard knows the direction and distance to her staff, so long as it is on the same plane.

**Mighty Weapon (Su)**: The staff gains the bane, defending, flaming, frost, merciful, shock, or thundering special weapon ability. This ability applies to both ends of the staff. Once chosen, the bonus cannot be changed and does not function in the hands of anyone other than the staff's master.

**Return (Su)**: The master can summon the staff to her hand as a standard action, so long as it is on the same plane. When summoned in this way, the staff simply appears in its master's hand. Any effect targeting the staff or the master that prevents teleportation also blocks this ability.

##### Invested Symbol of Power

Once a staff has been imbued with a wizard's power, the spellcaster can further enhance it through feats like Enchant Staff, Imbued Defense, Imbued Strength, Invest Spell, and Recharge Staff. These feats each require further preparation and ornamentation of the staff, and as such are classified as item creation feats.

##### Enhancing an Imbued Staff

A wizard with the Craft Staff feat wishing to add powers to her imbued staff as if it were a normal staff may do so, however all costs associated with its creation are increased by 20%. This reflects the difficulty in overlaying the newer abilities with the existing powers. A staff crafted in this manner is created with 50 charges. It retains any imbued powers and its magical nature, even after the charges are expended.

#### Impromptu Metamagic

Sorcerers typically seek to maximize their limited spell selection by utilizing metamagic feats. Other arcane spellcasters also adjust their spells with these feats in order to keep their enemies guessing or to find added flexibility for their lower-level spells. This ability allows you to spontaneously apply metamagic feats to your spells.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Each day, you may choose a metamagic feat you have. You can cast spells affected by that feat without increasing the spell level or casting time of the spells. You may not use any other metamagic feats that day. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 5 minus the level adjustment of the metamagic feat. (Thus, you may use Quicken Spell in this way once per day, while you could use Silent Spell four times per day.)

You may apply the metamagic feat spontaneously, as you cast the spell. If you prepare spells, you do not need to prepare the spells with the metamagic feat already applied.

Even though this ability does not increase the spell's level, you must be able to cast spells of the level the spell would be if you applied the metamagic feat normally. For example, a quickened magic missile would normally require a 5th-level spell slot. With this ability you may cast a quickened magic missile as a 1st-level spell, but you must still be able to cast 5th-level spells.



#### Metamagic Specialist

With a limited selection of spells at his fingertips, it's natural for a sorcerer to turn to metamagic feats to gain flexibility in effects. If the idea of playing a sorcerer who efficiently twists his spells into new shapes and sizes excites you, the metamagic specialist alternative class feature is the way to go. Though you must forgo the benefits of a familiar to pursue this path, some sorcerers relish not having to keep track of such a vulnerable accessory.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: You can apply metamagic feats that you know to sorcerer spells without increasing the casting time. This benefit even lets you quicken your sorcerer spells with the Quicken Spell feat.

You can use this class feature a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Int modifier (minimum 1). This is an extraordinary ability.

#### Planar Sorcerer

Though many claim a sorcerer's power derives from draconic heritage, a few sorcerers believe that their arcane prowess comes from an even purer source - the planes themselves. It isn't uncommon to see sorcerers traveling the multiverse in search of support for this belief.

Unlike other spellcasters, the sorcerer has a limited ability to customize his talents for planar adventuring. With a small list of spells known, the sorcerer who wishes to adapt to life on the planes must choose his tools wisely. Even so, the wide variety of challenges awaiting the planar sorcerer demands a slightly more adaptable approach to spellcasting.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a sorcerer planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 5th, 9th, or 13th level of sorcerer.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Sorcerer planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard sorcerer class plus [[Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Sorcerer Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Force-charged energy|See text|
|9th|+4|+3|+3|+6|Extraplanar spell penetration|See text|
|13th|+6/+1|+4|+4|+8|Spontaneous planar summoning|See text|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the sorcerer's planar substitution levels.

**Force-Charged Energy (Su)**: At 5th level, a planar sorcerer can lace his spells with pure force, the better to affect the various energy-resistant elementals and outsiders he faces. At the sorcerer's option, half of the energy damage dealt by a spell he casts is replaced by force damage. This effect can be applied to any spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

The maximum spell level to which a planar sorcerer can apply this effect is one lower than the highest level of sorcerer spell that he can cast. For instance, a 5th-level planar sorcerer can apply this effect to 0-level and 1st-level sorcerer spells, while an 18th-level planar sorcerer can apply it to spells of up to 8th level.

This benefit replaces the ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 5th level. From now on, the sorcerer's number of 2nd-level spells known at any class level is one less than the value shown on Table: [[#Sorcerer Spells Known]].

**Extraplanar Spell Penetration (Ex)**: A 9th-level planar sorcerer can imbue his spells with the ability to penetrate the spell resistance of extraplanar creatures more readily. Three times per day, for 1 round each time, the sorcerer can add his Charisma bonus to all his caster level checks made to overcome the spell resistance of extraplanar creatures.

This benefit replaces the ability to learn a new 4th-level spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 9th level. From now on, the sorcerer's number of 4th-level spells known at any class level is one less than the value shown on Table: [[#Sorcerer Spells Known]].

**Spontaneous Planar Summoning (Su)**: A 13th-level planar sorcerer learns to summon extraplanar creatures spontaneously. When he chooses this planar substitution benefit, a sorcerer selects one of the following categories: elementals (creatures of the elemental type), celestial creatures (creatures with the celestial template), or fiendish creatures (creatures with the fiendish template). He can use any spell slot to spontaneously cast a summon monster spell of the same level, but he can use that spell to summon only creatures of the selected category.

For example, a 13th-level sorcerer who chose elementals could use one of his 6th-level spell slots to cast summon monster VI. He could use that spell to summon a single Large elemental, or 1d3 Medium elementals (from the 5th-level summoning list). He could not use the spell to summon creatures that weren't elementals.

This benefit replaces the ability to learn a new 6th-level spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 13th level. From now on, the sorcerer's number of 6th-level spells known at any class level is one less than the value shown on Table: [[#Sorcerer Spells Known]].

#### Poltergeists

The magic lives inside sorcerers. It emerges in sparkling motes of power or dazzling bursts of energy that both terrify and delight. For the child destined to become a sorcerer magical outbursts promise greater things to come. Long before they learn to control their power would-be sorcerers plague their households with the unexpected and the unexplained. Called poltergeists ("noisy ghosts") by some scholars, this untamed magic leaves many parents fearful of restless spirits.

Sometimes a sorcerer never learns to fully control these first flashes of mystical energy and manifests his poltergeists even as an adult. Such a sorcerer lacks some of the flexibility of his comrades but gains unique abilities in exchange. A sorcerer character must choose to have a poltergeist at 1st level and must give up two 0-level spells. These lost spells mean the poltergeist-plagued sorcerer begins play with just three 0-level spells instead of five. In addition, the chosen spells cannot later be learned by the sorcerer. In a sense, the sorcerer has access to the chosen spells but they manifest in a different way. The exact nature and effect of a given poltergeist depends upon the spells that underpin it. The poltergeists shown here are merely the most common. Many others exist.

**Crawling Coins (Su)**: Your first word likely being "Mine," your loathing of sharing somehow gives life to small objects on your person, sending them scuttling away from those hoping to take them from you. You may use Sleight of Hand to conceal objects on your body even if you put no skill ranks in it. Further, anyone attempting to use Sleight of Hand to take something from you suffers a -4 penalty.

_Spells lost_: Prestidigitation and open/close.

**Fanfare (Su)**: Perhaps coddled a bit too much as a child, you feel a sense of uniqueness and entitlement that causes you to enter rooms amidst a flourish of glorious sounds and pyrotechnics. You may, as a conscious act of will similar to holding your breath, suppress this ability, allowing you to sneak into a room. Doing so, however, leaves you feeling strangely diminished. When you permit this ability to function normally you gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks for an hour against anyone who witnesses your spectacular entrance.

_Spells lost_: Dancing lights and ghost sounds.

**Frost Fingers (Su)**: Often belabored for your clumsiness as a child, it sometimes seems as if your merest touch causes objects to shatter and crack. Whenever you first touch an object with a hardness of 2 or less it must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Charisma modifier) or take damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This damage ignores hardness. If the item makes its saving throw or endures the damage you may handle it normally thereafter.

_Spells lost_: Ray of frost and touch of fatigue.

**That'll Leave a Mark! (Su)**: Called a bully by many, the secret satisfaction you gained from making playmates cry "uncle" somehow caused you to leave a record of their submission visible to all. Whenever you successfully strike an opponent with an unarmed attack or touch attack she must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Charisma modifier) or develop a bruise in a shape you desire in the area you struck. This bruise heals normally in a week and is removed by any amount of magical healing.

_Spells lost_: Acid splash and arcane mark.

**The Pinch (Su)**: A solitary and eccentric child, often targeted by bullies with rocks or rotted food, you developed a minor but effective way of distracting your tormentors. Once per day as a standard action you can target a spellcaster concentrating on a spell and force the spellcaster to succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level of spell being concentrated on) or lose the spell. This disrupting effect cannot be used on a spell as it is being cast.

_Spells lost_: Flare and mage hand.

#### Raptoran Sorcerer

The raptoran sorcerer has an almost instinctive command of the magical forces required to manipulate the air beneath his wings. He loses some versatility in spellcasting but gains the ability to cast additional air-based spells and even the service of an elemental familiar.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a raptoran sorcerer substitution level, a character must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 5th, or 11th level of sorcerer.

##### Class Skills

Raptoran sorcerer substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard sorcerer class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Raptoran Sorcerer Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+0|+2|Air magic, elemental familiar|Same as sorcerer|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Air magic, command the winds|See text|
|11th|+5|+3|+3|+7|Air magic, spell on the wing|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the raptoran sorcerer's racial substitution levels.

**Air Magic**: The following spells are considered to be on a raptoran sorcerer's class spell list (and thus may be selected as known spells at the appropriate levels):

_4th level_: Air walk.

_5th level_: Control winds.

_7th level_: Wind walk.

_8th level_: Whirlwind.

A raptoran sorcerer gains this class feature if he selects any of the indicated raptoran sorcerer substitution levels (1st, 5th, or 11th).

**Elemental Familiar (Ex)**: A 1st-level raptoran sorcerer can obtain a Small air elemental as a familiar. The elemental's hit points are equal to its normal hit points or one half its master's hit points, whichever are greater. The elemental familiar does not gain the ability to speak with animals. This familiar otherwise functions identically to the standard sorcerer's familiar ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer's familiar ability gained at 1st level.

**Command the Winds**: A 5th-level raptoran sorcerer adds gust of wind, whispering wind, and wind wall to his list of spells known. Wind wall is henceforth treated as a 2nd-level spell for the raptoran sorcerer.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer's ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell at 5th level. From this point on, the raptoran sorcerer's number of 2nd-level spells known (not including the gust of wind, whispering wind, and wind wall spells) is one less than the value shown on Table: [[#Sorcerer Spells Known]].

**Spell on the Wing (Ex)**: When airborne and casting a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less, a raptoran sorcerer of 11th level or higher can move both before and after spellcasting, provided that his total distance moved is not greater than his speed.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer's ability to learn a new 5th-level spell at 11th level. From this point on, the raptoran sorcerer's number of 5th-level spells known is one less than the value shown on Table: [[#Sorcerer Spells Known]].

#### School Mastery

Some specialist wizards take their mastery to whole new levels. Occasionally, even sorcerers and other arcane spellcasters focus their attentions on one school over the others. Your expertise in a chosen school of magic is unparalleled.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Choose a school of magic. If you are already a specialist wizard, you may only choose the school in which you are specialized. You cast all spells from the chosen school at +1 caster level. In addition, you gain the following benefit, based on the school you select.

_Abjuration_: Any non-instantaneous, nonpermanent abjuration spell you cast on someone other than yourself that does not require concentration has double the duration. You cannot use this ability on any spell whose duration you affect in any other way, such as with the Extend Spell metamagic feat.

_Conjuration_: Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Wisdom for the duration of the spell that summoned it.

_Divination_: Whenever you cast a divination spell, you immediately gain a +2 insight bonus on Listen and Spot skill checks for 1 hour per level of the spell you cast (0-level spells grant the bonus for 30 minutes).

_Enchantment_: For 24 hours after an enchantment spell you cast expires, the target of your spell takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made to resist your spells or spell-like abilities. You may affect only one creature at a time in this way. If your enchantment spell affected multiple targets, you must choose one creature against whom the penalty applies. Whenever an enchantment spell you cast expires while such a penally is active, the old penalty immediately disappears.

_Evocation_: Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, that spell deals +1 point of damage.

_Illusion_: Whenever you cast an illusion (shadow) spell that creates a partially real effect (such as shadow conjuration or shadow evocation), the effect is 10% more real than normal. Thus, a creature created by shadow conjuration is 30% as strong as a real creature of the same kind, instead of the normal 20%.

_Necromancy_: Each undead creature you create with any evil spell gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level. These temporary hit points last indefinitely, only disappearing when your creation takes damage. They cannot be regained once lost.

_Transmutation_: Whenever you cast a spell that alters a creature's form, kind, or type, the DC to resist the spell increases by +1.

#### Sorcerer Spheres

Some sorcerers have figured out how to tap deeper into the power of their magical ancestors, gaining access to spheres or power over which those ancestors controlled. Specialist sorcerers have themes, referred to among arcane scholars as spheres.

A sphere represents an area with which you have an easier time focusing your arcane energies. Your sphere is the result of a powerful magical creature as an ancestor. You must choose your sphere at 1st level, and you may not change your sphere once you select it nor may you get rid of your sphere in order to become a general sorcerer. You cast all spells from your sphere at +1 caster level. This bonus does not apply to the use of spell trigger and spell completion items that use spells from your sphere.

Your sphere has an opposite, however, a type of magic in which your power is weaker. You cast all spells from your opposed sphere at -2 caster levels. Note that this penalty can delay your access to some spells. For example, if Aphrella has fire as her opposed sphere, she would need to wait until she was a 7th-level caster until she could cast fireball. In addition, you are unable to activate spell trigger and spell completion items from your opposed sphere.

Spheres should be narrower than spell schools, but not so narrow as to only affect a handful of spells. You and your DM should work together to determine what is fair for your campaign. When creating spheres and opposed spheres, the number of spells on each list should be roughly equal and of the same overall power. For example, while spells of the compulsion subschool might make a good sphere, spells of the charm subschool would make a poor opposed sphere since so few spells exist in that subschool. A spell might appear in multiple schools of magic.

##### EXAMPLE SPHERES

Presented here are five sample spheres which you can reverse for a total of ten useable spheres. For example, you can reverse the fire sphere to create the cold sphere. All spells with the cold descriptor belong to the cold sphere while all spells with the fire descriptor become your opposed sphere. Use these spheres as templates for creating your own.

**Acid**: An especially powerful black dragon is among your ancestors. Spells with the acid descriptor belong to your sphere. Spells with the electricity descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

**Air**: One of your ancestors was a djinni. Spells with the air descriptor belong to your sphere. Spells with the earth descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

**Fire**: A fire giant resides in your family tree. Spells with the fire descriptor belong to your sphere. Spells with the cold descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

**Shadow**: A powerful denizen of the Plane of Shadow is one of your relatives. Spells from the illusion (shadow) subschool belong to your sphere. Spells with the light descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

**Summoning**: A powerful conjurer resides in your family's ancestry. Spells from the conjuration (summoning) subschool belong to your sphere. Spells from the conjuration (creation) make up your opposed sphere.

#### Spell Shield

As a powerful spellcaster, you're likely to attract the attention of powerful opponents, and your teammates can't always protect you. Spell shield lets you use your spells' energy to offset damage that might otherwise kill you.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: By achieving oneness with the magical energy from which you draw your power, you make it part of your life force. As an immediate action when you take damage from any source, you can attempt to sacrifice spell energy instead of losing hit points. Expend a spell slot as if you had cast a spell of that level. Then, make a Concentration check with a DC equal to 15 + the level of the sacrificed spell. If you succeed, you ignore an amount of damage equal to five times the level of the spell slot you gave up. If you fail, you still lose the spell, but the magical energy fails to negate any of the damage.

For example, Hennet finds himself in the way of a black dragon's breath. Although he succeeded on his saving throw, he is still going to take 22 points of acid damage. As a 7th-level sorcerer, Hennet can sacrifice a spell of up to 3rd level. He chooses a 3rd-level spell, so the DC of his Concentration check is 18. Hennet gets a result of 22 and magically negates 15 points of the acid damage, taking only 7 points.

You can attempt to deflect damage as often as you wish, but you can make only one attempt per round. If an attack's damage has multiple sources (such as that of a flaming sword, which deals both weapon damage and fire damage), you must choose which source to negate. If an attack must deal damage to have a secondary effect (such as poison from a snake's bite), negating all the damage also prevents the secondary effect.

#### Stalwart Sorcerer

Most sorcerers hide behind walls of steel, slinging spells at enemies safely distant. You have no patience for such cowards and prefer to be near the front line. Your breadth of magical [[Knowledge]] might not compare with those craven weaklings, but you are proud to dive into the fray alongside the fighter.

**Class**: Sorcerer.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: [[Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: Reduce by one the number of sorcerer spells known for your highest spell level (to a minimum of one). As a 1st-level character, you have one 1st-level spell known rather than two.

When you would gain a second known spell from a higher level, apply this penalty to the new spell level but remove it from the lower level. For example, at 5th level, you reduce your 2nd-level spells known from two to one but you gain the previously unavailable 1st-level spell (increasing your 1st-level spells known from three to four).

**Benefit**: You gain extra hit points equal to two times your sorcerer class level. Every time you advance a level, you gain another 2 extra hit points. (So, at 1st level you have 2 extra hit points, at 2nd level you have 4 extra hit points, and so on.)

You also gain the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat for a melee weapon of your choice, as well as Weapon Focus with that weapon.

#### Wilderness Companion

A sorcerer or [[Wizard]] might desire a more durable companion to accompany him on excursions into the wilderness.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Familiar.

**Gain**: Animal companion (as [[Druid]]; treat sorcerer or wizard as a druid of half his class level).

#### Witch

Below is a new spell list for a variant spellcasting class: the witch. A staple of fantasy literature and fairy tales, the witch dabbles in many kinds of magic - minor illusions, spells dealing with health or life, nature-based magic, simple divinations, and spells that alter the shape and appearance of things - but excels at just a few. Hence, her list is somewhat limited, but it contains wizard, cleric, and druid spells. She casts spells as a sorcerer, using the sorcerer's Spells per Day table, and her spells are based on Charisma. The witch's spell list is designed with the following considerations in mind.

**Cure Spells**: Only the weakest of these, and the witch doesn't have the cleric's ability to cast cure spells spontaneously. The witch isn't blessed with a cleric's (or druid's) plethora of healing spells, but she can offer a little aid to those she favors.

**Illusions**: Only through the middle levels. A witch can trick her foes, but not to the extent that a wizard can.

**Divinations**: Only the straight-forward divinations, such as clairvoyance/clairaudience and scrying, and not even all of them.

**Charms**: Many. A major feature of this class.

**Form-Changing**: Another strong point for the witch. From alter self to shapechange, the witch has most of the spells relating to changing her (or someone else's) form.

**Nature**: From speaking to animals to controlling the weather, the witch dabbles in this type of magic, if for no other reason than she usually lives a secluded life in the wilderness.

**No Flashy Spells**: Anything from a lightning bolt to a wall of fire to a Bigby's hand spell is right out. The witch's archetype doesn't suggest overt attack spells or spells that create massive magic constructs. She doesn't summon monsters, place wards, or teleport from place to place. Her magic is subtle.

**Miscellaneous**: Spells such as whispering wind, Leomund's tiny hut, bestow curse (and a few other curse-like spells), and a few communication spells round out the list.
