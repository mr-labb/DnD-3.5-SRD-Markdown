### CLERIC

<br><br>The handiwork of the gods is everywhere - in places of natural beauty, in mighty crusades, in soaring temples, and in the hearts of worshipers. Like people, gods run the gamut from benevolent to malicious, reserved to intrusive, simple to inscrutable. The gods, however, work mostly through intermediaries - their clerics. Good clerics heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage. A cleric uses the power of his god to make his god's will manifest. And if a cleric uses his god's power to improve his own lot, that's to be expected, too.<br><br>Ideally, a cleric's adventures support his god's causes, at least in a general way. A good cleric, for example, helps those in need. If, through noble acts, he can improve the reputation to his god or temple, that's even better. An evil cleric seeks to increase his own power and that of his deity, so that others will respect and fear both.<br><br>Clerics sometimes receive orders, or at least suggestions, from their ecclesiastical superiors, directing them to undertake missions for the church. The clerics and their companions are compensated fairly for these missions, and the church may be especially generous with the casting of needed spells or divine magic items as payment. Of course, clerics are people, too, and they may have any or all the more common motivations for adventuring.<br><br>Clerics are masters of divine magic, which is especially good at healing. Even an inexperienced cleric can bring people back from the brink of death, and an experienced cleric can bring back people who have crossed over that brink. As channelers of divine energy, clerics can affect undead creatures. A good cleric can turn away or even destroy undead; an evil cleric can bring undead under his control. Clerics have some combat training. They can use simple weapons, and they are trained in the use of armor, since armor does not interfere with divine spells the way it does with arcane spells.<br><br>Alignment: Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Because people more readily worship good deities than neutral or evil ones, there are more good than evil clerics. Clerics also tend toward law instead of chaos, since lawful religions tend to be more structured and better able to recruit and train clerics than chaotic ones.<br><br>Typically, a cleric is the same alignment as his deity, though some clerics are one step away from their respective deities in alignment. For example, most clerics of Heironeous, the god of valor (who is lawful good) are lawful good, but some are lawful neutral or neutral good. Additionally, a cleric may not be neutral (that is, neutral on both the good-evil axis and the lawful-chaotic axis) unless his deity is neutral.<br><br>Every reasonably well-known deity has clerics devoted to him or her, so clerics can be of any religion. The deity most common worshiped by human clerics in civilized lands is Pelor (god of the sun). The majority of nonhuman clerics are devoted to the chief god of the appropriate racial pantheon. Most clerics are officially ordained members of religious organizations, commonly called churches. Each has sworn to uphold the ideals of his church. Some clerics devote themselves not to a god but to a cause or a source of [[divine power]]. These characters wield magic the way clerics devoted to individual gods do, but they are not associated with any religious institution or any particular practice of worship. A cleric devoted to good and law, for example, may be on friendly terms with the clerics of lawful and good deities and may extol the virtues of a good and lawful life, but he is not a functionary in a church hierarchy.<br><br>Most clerics join their churches as young adults, though some are devoted to a god's service from a young age, and a few feel the call later in life. While some clerics are tightly bound to their churches' activities on a daily basis, others have more freedom to conduct their lives as they please, as long as they do so in accordance with their gods' wishes.<br><br>Clerics of a given religion are all supposed to get along, though schisms within a church are often more bitter than conflicts between religions. Clerics who share some basic ideals, such as goodness or lawfulness, may find common cause with each other and see themselves as part of an order or body that supersedes any given religion. Clerics of opposed goals, however, are sworn enemies. In civilized lands, open warfare between religions occurs only during civil wars and similar social upheavals, but vicious politicking between opposed churches is common.<br><br>All the common races are represented in this class, since the need for religion and divine magic is universal. The clerics of most races, however, are too focused on their religious duties to undertake an adventurer's life. Crusading, adventuring clerics most often come from the human and dwarf races. Among the savage humanoids, clerics are less common. The exception is troglodytes, who take well to divine magic and are often led by priests, who make a practice of sacrificing and devouring captives.<br><br>In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody's friend and often the glue that holds the party together. As the one who can channel divine energy, a cleric is a capable healer, and adventurers of every class appreciate being put back together after they've taken some hard knocks. Clerics sometimes clash with druids, since druids represent an older, more primal relationship between the mortal and the divine. Mostly, though, the religion of a cleric determines how he gets along with others. A cleric of Olidammara (god of thieves), gets along fine with rogues and ne'er-do-wells, for example, while a cleric of Heironeous (god of valor) rankles at such company.<br><br>The cleric serves as a typical group's primary healer, diviner, and defensive specialist. He can hold his own in a fight but usually isn't well served by charging to the front of combat. The cleric's domains and spell selection can greatly affect his role as well.|

**Alignment**: A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his deity's (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity's alignment is also neutral.

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the cleric.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).

A cleric who chooses the [[War]] domain receives the [[Weapon Focus]] feat related to his deity's weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.

**Aura (Ex)**: A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the [[detect evil]] spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

**Spells**: A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the [[cleric spells list]]. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

**Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells**: A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two [[domains]] from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.

If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.

Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected. With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.

**Spontaneous Casting**: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in its name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

**Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su)**: Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).

A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above).

A cleric may attempt to [[turn undead]] a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

**Bonus Languages**: A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

###### Ex-Clerics

A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the [[atonement]] spell description).

#### Ancestral Speaker

Many cultures, both primitive and surprisingly advanced, give their religious devotion not to deities (or at least not solely to deities), but to the spirits of their departed ancestors. An ancestral speaker calls upon his forebears, and the deceased patriarchs and matriarchs of his clan, family, or nation, for spells and guidance. Unlike standard clerics, whose first devotion is often to their priesthood, an ancestral speaker serves and protects the honor of his ancestors and the well-being of his people with equal fervor. They are, after all, essentially the same thing; his people today are the family of those who have gone, and they themselves will one day be the ancestor spirits to following generations.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Class Skills

The ancestral speaker's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (history) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) (Int), [[Perform]] (Cha), [[Profession]] (Wis), [[Sense Motive]] (Wis), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int). Further, an ancestral speaker may choose any two cross-class skills to become class skills; these were taught to him by his ancestors during communion over the course of his training to become an ancestral speaker.

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the ancestral speaker.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The ancestral speaker is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

**Ancestral Communion (Ex)**: In addition to spells, the ancestral speaker may pray to his ancestors for advice or [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]]. At 1st level, the ancestral speaker may request a bonus on any one specific skill, once per day. The ancestors grant him temporary [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] of that skill, bestowing a competence bonus equal to the ancestral speaker's Charisma modifier plus his class level. It does not matter if the speaker already possesses any ranks in this skill or not; the ancestral speaker can use the skill even if he is untrained in its use or cannot normally use it. The bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 plus the ancestral speaker's Charisma bonus. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the ancestral speaker may use this power an additional time per day.

At 9th level, the ancestral speaker may choose to ask the ancestors' advice, rather than seeking their aid with skills. Instead of a skill bonus, he may choose to ask them questions, as per the commune spell cast by a cleric of his level. He may do this only once per day; any other uses of ancestral communion during that day must be requests for help with a skill.

**Holy Presence (Ex)**: The ancestral speaker is considered to be his own holy symbol, as he is descended from the beings on whom he calls. Thus, he need not carry any such symbol, and can cast spells with the Divine Focus component without one.

**Death Talker (Ex)**: Due to his long association with the spirits of the departed, the 4th-level ancestral speaker gains a +2 bonus to all Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against undead. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.

**Improved Resurrection (Ex)**: The ancestors on whom the speaker calls well know the pathways between life and death, and they can smooth over the transition for anyone making the crossing at their speaker's behest. Anyone raised or resurrected by an ancestral speaker still loses a level, but only a portion of the normal XP. Under most conditions, level loss drops the victim to the halfway point of the old level; someone raised by an ancestral speaker drops to the three-quarter mark. For example, a 9th-level character who is raised would normally drop to 32,000 XP. (A character needs 28,000 for 8th level and 36,000 for 9th, so half the difference is 4,000.) If that character was raised by a speaker, however, he would drop only to 34,000 XP.

#### Arcane Disciple

Many worlds have gods of magic and clerics who worship them. Some clerics, however, give their devotion not to any deity of magic but to the concept and forces of magic itself. They believe that magic represents the fundamental power underlying all reality and worship it as a force higher than any god. These arcane disciples believe that all magic is inherently linked, although they have only managed to cross the boundary between arcane and divine in minor fashion. Many arcane disciples multiclass as wizards and go on to obtain the mystic theurge prestige class.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Class Skills

The arcane disciple's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), Decipher Script (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (history) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), [[SpellCraft]] (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the arcane disciple.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The arcane disciple is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

**Arcane to Divine (Ex)**: At every level, the arcane disciple may choose one arcane spell from either the bard or sorcerer/wizard spell list. This spell must be at least one level lower than the highest-level divine spell the character may cast. The arcane disciple may then add this spell to her normal clerical spell list, and forever after may cast it as a divine spell like any other. Furthermore, while the arcane disciple does not technically possess the [[Magic domain]] (as she has no domains to choose from), all the spells of the Magic domain are considered divine spells for the arcane disciple, and are added to her cleric spell list in addition to any arcane spells she chooses as she advances in level.

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, at 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, the arcane disciple gains a bonus feat. These feats must be either metamagic or item creation feats.

#### Aspirant

Among some religious orders, the goal of the initiates is not to serve the gods but to become like them. Some cultures believe divine ascension is possible - that mortals can rise to take a seat beside the gods themselves. Others maintain that mortals cannot become divinities but that they might yet serve the gods on a higher plane as saints or proxies. Still others believe that even if they never achieve true ascension through their endeavors, their efforts to imitate the divine raise them above their fellow mortals.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Class Skills

The aspirant's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (history) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the aspirant.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The aspirant is proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

**Spontaneous Casting**: At 1st level, the aspirant gains the ability to lose any prepared clerical spell for any other clerical spell of equal or lower level, but only once per day. She may cast a spontaneous spell twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 8th, four times per day at 12th, and five times per day at 16th level. This represents the aspirant's growing ability to manipulate divine energies directly.

**Shield of the Divine (Ex)**: At 1st level, the aspirant gains a +1 bonus to AC. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, the bonus increases by +1. This bonus applies even when the aspirant is flat-footed or helpless.

**Divine Counterspell (Sp)**: An aspirant of 3rd-level or higher may counter a divine spell cast by another spellcaster without expending a spell for the day. The aspirant must be high enough level to cast a spell of the same level as the spell she wishes to counter. To do so, an aspirant must ready an action to counterspell as normal, but the aspirant need not determine what the spell is. If the spell cast is not a divine spell, the aspirant cannot counter it, but she does not waste her use of this ability, only her action. The aspirant can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

**Perfect Self**: At 20th level, the aspirant has become so fully connected with the power of the divine that she becomes a magical creature. This ability has the same effect as the monk ability of the same name.



#### Azurin Cleric

An azurin cleric dedicates herself not only to a deity or pantheon, but also to the power of incarnum. Just as most azurins cleave to polarized alignments, azurin clerics take extreme positions on morals and ethics. Azurin clerics prefer to battle foes opposed to their alignment, and work best with other incarnum-wielding characters.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take an azurin cleric substitution level, a character must be an azurin about to take her 1st, 4th, or 9th level of cleric.

##### Class Skills

Azurin cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard cleric class, plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the azurin cleric racial substitution levels.

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: An azurin cleric who selects any azurin cleric substitution level loses the ability to cast any spells of an alignment that doesn't match her own. For example, a chaotic good azurin cleric can't cast evil or lawful spells.

This restriction replaces the standard cleric restriction regarding what alignment of spells the cleric can cast.

**Channel Incarnum (Su)**: An azurin cleric channels incarnum rather than mere positive or negative energy. Once per round as a free action, an azurin cleric can grant herself bonus essentia equal to her Charisma bonus or one-half her cleric level (whichever is lower), minimum 1. This essentia lasts for 1 round.

The character can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces a standard cleric's ability to turn or rebuke undead gained at 1st level. An azurin cleric can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead to qualify for any divine feat, and can spend daily uses of this feat to power divine feats as if they were daily uses of turn or rebuke undead (though doing so requires a standard action rather than a free action unless the feat states otherwise).

**Soultouched Weapon (Su)**: Beginning at 4th level, an azurin cleric can use incarnum to imbue her weapon with the power of her soul's convictions. This requires a move action and grants a single held melee weapon an alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment chosen must be part of the azurin cleric's alignment; for example, a chaotic good azurin cleric could choose to make her weapon chaotic or good, but not lawful or evil. A neutral azurin cleric gains no benefit from this class feature.

While this ability is in effect, an azurin cleric can also invest essentia in the affected weapon. The weapon gains an insight bonus equal to the invested essentia on damage rolls against creatures whose alignment includes a component opposed to the chosen alignment. For example, a good weapon would deal an extra 1 point of damage per point of invested essentia against evil creatures (whether lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil).

The effects of this ability last for a number of rounds equal to 3 + one-half her class level. An azurin cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From this point forward, the number of 2nd-level spell slots possessed by an azurin cleric is reduced by one.

**Distribute Incarnum (Su)**: A 9th-level azurin cleric can enhance the essentia pools of nearby allies by distributing free-flowing incarnum in the environment. This requires the cleric to sacrifice a cleric spell of 5th level or higher (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and grants all allies (including herself) within 30 feet bonus essentia equal to the spell's level. All affected characters can immediately invest this essentia without spending an action (though currently invested essentia may not be shifted). The essentia lasts until the end of the cleric's next turn.

If an ally has no essentia pool, she can instead choose to heal 1 hp of damage per point of essentia that would be granted. This applies equally to all living and undead creatures, regardless of whether the cleric would normally spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells.

This benefit replaces a standard cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells of 5th level and above.

|9th|+6/+1|+6|+3|+6|Distribute incarnum|See text|

  

#### Benevolent

In many cultures, the primary function of the cleric is to bless the undertakings of others, to grant the gods' favor on those who labor in their name. The benevolent exemplifies this role. A benevolent is devoted to aiding and abetting others in their times of need and to increasing the good fortune of his allies. The benevolent is as capable in combat as any cleric - otherwise he could not accompany soldiers on the battlefield - but his focus is on their needs, not his own. The vast majority of benevolents are good-aligned, although evil ones are not unheard of.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Class Skills

The benevolent's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (history) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

|20th|+15/+10/+5|+12|+6|+12|Luck of the gods 5/day|6|5|5|5|5|5|4|4|4|4|

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the benevolent.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The benevolent is proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (including tower shields).

**Spontaneous Casting (Ex)**: The benevolent has a wider range of spontaneous spells than the standard cleric, although they are all geared toward aiding others. The benevolent may lose any prepared spell of equal or higher level in exchange for any of the following spells:

_0_ - [[cure minor wounds]], guidance, resistance;

_1st_ - [[bless]], [[cure light wounds]], [[sanctuary]];

_2nd_ - aid, [[cure moderate wounds]], shield other;

_3rd_ - [[cure serious wounds]], [[prayer]], [[remove curse]];

_4th_ - [[cure critical wounds]], restoration, [[Compendium/Spells/Spell Immunity|spell immunity]];

_5th_ - [[atonement]], [[Cure Light Wounds Mass|mass cure light wounds]];

_6th_ - [[Cure Moderate Wounds Mass|mass cure moderate wounds]], heal;

_7th_ - [[Restoration Greater|greater restoration]], [[Cure Serious Wounds Mass|mass cure serious wounds]];

_8th_ - [[Cure Critical Wounds Mass|mass cure critical wounds]];

_9th_ - [[Heal Mass|mass heal]].

**Luck of the Gods (Sp)**: Starting at 4th level, the benevolent can, with a brief benediction, bestow good fortune upon others. The recipient of this prayer may, any time within the next 24 hours, reroll any single die roll, as per the granted power for the Luck Domain. If the blessing is not used within 24 hours, it is lost. Additionally, the recipient may add a luck bonus equal to the benevolent's Charisma bonus to any single roll during that 24-hour period. These two effects can be applied to the same roll. The benevolent may not use this power on himself, and he may use it only upon someone within one alignment step of his deity. Multiple applications of luck of the gods do not stack. This power may be used once per day at 4th level, twice per day at 8th level, three times per day at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and five times per day at 20th level.

#### Blasphemous Incantation

Not all evil deities or fiendish powers are concerned with undead. Some grant their mortal servants the ability to channel their unholy will in the form of a blasphemous incantation.

**Class**: Cleric.

**Level**: 1st (cleric).

**Special Requirement**: To select this class feature, you must be evil. If your alignment changes to something other than evil, you lose access to this class feature until your alignment is restored to evil.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you lose the ability to rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You can call upon your evil master to smite your enemies. All good creatures within 30 feet must succeed on Fortitude saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier) or become sickened for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).

You can utter a blasphemous incantation a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. If you have 5 or more ranks in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion), the DC of the Fortitude save increases by 2.

Blasphemous incantation is a supernatural ability.

#### Champion

Some clerics prefer to be champions of good (or evil), standing at the forefront of the battle against the enemy.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Turn undead.

**Gain**: Smite evil, if the cleric would normally channel positive energy, or smite good, if the cleric would normally channel negative energy (as [[paladin]]); aura of courage (as [[paladin]]).

#### Cloistered Cleric

The cloistered cleric spends more time than other clerics in study and prayer and less in martial training. He gives up some of the cleric's combat prowess in exchange for greater skill access and a wider range of spells devoted to [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (and the protection of [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]]).

Most cloistered clerics are nonchaotic, since they believe that a disciplined lifestyle lends itself better to learning.

**Hit Die**: The cloistered cleric uses a d6 for his Hit Die (and has hit points at 1st level equal to 6 + Con modifier).

**Base Attack Bonus**: The cloistered cleric's lack of martial training means that he uses the poor base attack bonus.

##### Class Skills

The cloistered cleric's class skill list includes [[Decipher Script]], [[Speak Language]], and all [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] skills (from the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain]], see below). The cloistered cleric gains skill points per level equal to 6 + Int modifier (and has this number × 4 at 1st level).

##### Class Features

The cloistered cleric has all the standard cleric class features, except as noted below.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Cloistered clerics are proficient with [[simple weapons]] and with [[light armor]].

**Lore (Ex)**: Thanks to long hours of study, a cloistered cleric has a wide range of stray [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]]. This ability is identical to the bard's [[bardic [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] class feature, using the cloistered cleric's class level in place of the bard level.

**Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells**: Most cloistered clerics worship deities associated with [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] and learning.

In addition to any domains selected from his deity's list, a cloistered cleric automatically gains the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain]] as a bonus domain (even if the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain is not normally available to clerics of that deity). He gains the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain granted power and may select his bonus domain spell from the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain or from one of his two regular domains.

**Spellcasting**: Add the following spells to the cloistered cleric's class spell list:

0 - [[message]];

1st - [[erase]], [[identify]], [[unseen servant]];

2nd - [[foxs cunning|fox's cunning]];

3rd - [[illusory script]], [[secret page]], [[tongues]] (reduced from 4th level);

4th - [[detect scrying]];

6th - [[analyze dweomer]];

7th - [[sequester]];

9th - [[vision]].

#### Crusader

The crusader is a holy warrior, a martial priest dedicated to battling the enemies of his church and spreading the teachings of his deity throughout the lands. The crusader is in many respects akin to the paladin, but is devoted solely to ridding the world of the followers of enemy gods, rather than the paladin's code. She wields weapon and spell with equal faculty, and is willing either to lead others into battle or to stand against the enemy alone.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Class Skills

The crusader's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (history) (Int), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), Ride, (Dex), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (2 + Int modifier) × 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the crusader.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The crusader is proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (including tower shields). In addition, the crusader may choose a single martial weapon with which she is proficient, as though she had the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat.

**Deific Foe (Ex)**: At 1st level and every 5 levels thereafter, a crusader must choose a deity opposed to her own god. The crusader gains a +4 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls against worshipers of the chosen deific foe.

**Turn Foe's Followers (Su)**: Starting at ist level, the crusader may turn or destroy worshipers of her deific foe. This is resolved just like a normal cleric's turn undead ability, except that the ability only affects worshipers of the deific foe. A crusader can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. A crusader with 5 or more ranks of [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) gains a +2 bonus on turning checks against worshipers of her deific foe.

**Bonus Feats**: The crusader gains a bonus feat at 3rd level and every five levels thereafter. These feats must come from the fighter's bonus feat list, with the following alteration: Remove Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization from the list (as clerics cannot take those feats), and replace it with Combat Casting.

**Smite (Su)**: Once per day, beginning at 5th level, a crusader may make a smite attack against any foe, so long as the foe does not worship the crusader's deity and does not share either the deity's or the crusader's alignment. She adds her Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per crusader level. If the crusader accidentally smites a creature that does not qualify by the above conditions, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the day. At 10th, 15th, and 20th level the crusader gains an additional smite attempt per day.

#### Dead Levels

The cleric has nineteen dead levels, but this is mitigated by their one and only special ability: turn or rebuke undead. The turning damage for this ability steadily increases every level (2d6 + the cleric's level + the cleric's Charisma modifier). Still, a prestige class that grants +1 level of divine spellcasting, normal turn or rebuke undead advancement, and special abilities at every level opens the door for a minor dead level ability.

**Undead Intuition (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a cleric can identify undead creatures during an encounter from any distance. The cleric gains a +2 bonus on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) checks to identify undead creatures, but gains no insight about their special powers or vulnerabilities. See the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] skill description. Moreover, the cleric can make these [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (undead) checks untrained. This bonus increases by +1 for each cleric level the character takes after 2nd level.



#### Destroy Undead

You can channel positive energy to destroy undead creatures.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn undead.

**Benefit**: Instead of the cleric's normal ability to turn or rebuke undead, a lightbringer cleric can channel positive energy to destroy undead. Thus, a lightbringer cleric contributes to the destruction of undead in a fashion that interacts well with the other characters in the party such as the fighter and wizard. Lightbringer clerics want to destroy undead; thus, they despise seeing turned undead run away never seen again. At other times, a standard turning effect has no effect whatsoever, much to the chagrin of the lightbringer cleric.

Destroying undead is a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage per cleric level to all undead within 30 feet of the cleric. The affected undead get a Will save (DC 10 + cleric level + Cha modifier) for half damage. Undead with turn resistance can subtract that number from the damage that they take from each turn attempt. For example, a vampire with turn resistance +4 takes 4 fewer points of damage each time he takes turning damage.

When using this ability against incorporeal creatures, the lightbringer cleric does not have to roll a 50% miss chance; turning hits them automatically.

Destroy undead still counts as turn undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats, prestige classes, and so forth. A lightbringer cleric can use this ability the same number of times per day that he could turn undead. If a feat requires the expenditure of one or more uses of turn undead, it instead consumes uses of this ability. Any ability that grants a bonus to turning checks instead grants an equal bonus to this ability's save DC. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Divine Counterspell

Although the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics (and paladins) find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters. The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge.

**Class**: Cleric or paladin.

**Level**: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).

**Special Requirement**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain the supernatural ability to counter another spellcaster's magic through pure force of will. This ability functions just as if you were using [[dispel magic]] to counter the spell, except that you add your cleric level (instead of your caster level) to the d20 roll. You don't need to identify the spell the opposing spellcaster is casting to make the attempt.

If you don't have a cleric level, use your effective cleric level for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a paladin would normally turn undead as a cleric of three levels lower; her effective cleric level for counterspelling is equal to her paladin level - 3.

You can attempt to counterspell a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Cha modifier.

A character with 5 or more ranks in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) gets a +2 bonus on counterspelling attempts when using this ability.

#### Divine Magician

Deities influence the world through the divine spells they grant their worshipers. Some clerics, however, choose to explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided by the gods. By giving up some of their [[divine power]], these clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities.

This class feature can be chosen only once.

**Class**: Cleric.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You gain only one domain (including spells and granted power) at 1st level, rather than two.

**Benefit**: You can add one 1st-level abjuration, divination, or necromancy wizard spell to your cleric spell list. Each time you gain the ability to cast a new level of cleric spells, you can add a single wizard spell of the same level from one of those schools to your cleric spell list.

#### Divine Restoration

When you or your teammates lose your strength in the middle of a dungeon, you can't always "call it a day" and rest. You can restore the party's hit points by trading spells for healing magic, but other setbacks besides physical injury might impede your progress: insidious disease, vermin poison, or noxious fumes. By focusing your divine purpose, you can restore your party's lost abilities.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you sacrifice one of your domain granted powers.

**Benefit**: At 3rd level, select one of your chosen cleric domains. You can still select and cast spells from that domain list, but you no longer can use the domain's granted power. Instead, you gain the ability to spontaneously cast [[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]], [[restoration]], or [[Restoration Greater|greater restoration]] by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same level.

For example, Jozan is 3rd level and selects this alternate class feature. He had chosen the Healing and Protection domains at 1st level. He gives up the Healing domain granted power. He no longer casts healing spells at +1 caster level, but he can sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell to spontaneously cast [[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]]. At 7th level, he'll be able to sacrifice a 4th-level spell to cast [[restoration]], and at 13th level, a 7th-level spell to cast [[Restoration Greater|greater restoration]].

**Special**: When spontaneously casting a restoration spell, you must still expend the required components.

#### Domain Focus

Clerics lose their way the most easily, especially at lower levels. Even more experienced clerics sometimes become shaken by unexpected tragedies. When a cleric loses his way and sees only the "pure" version of his deity, he focuses on a single aspect of his deity to the exclusion of all others.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you lose the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure or inflict spells. You also lose access to one of your domains and all spells on that domain spell list are permanently removed from all your spell lists.

**Benefit**: You gain many of the benefits of your remaining domain as if you had taken it twice.

You gain double the benefit from your remaining domain's granted power, if applicable. If your remaining domain granted power has a limited number of uses per day, you may use the domain granted power twice as many times per day; if your remaining domain granted power offers a bonus, the bonus is doubled. If your remaining domain granted power has limited uses and also grants a bonus (such as the granted power of the Destruction domain), you must choose which to double: the number of times per day you can use it or double the bonus; you do not gain both. The number of uses per day that doubles dots not count additional uses based on ability scores. For example, domain granted powers that grant you the ability to turn or rebuke elemental creatures grant you that ability a number of times per day equal to 6 + your Charisma modifier, and not 6 + double your Charisma modifier.

#### Dragonblood Cleric

Dragonblood creatures are naturally inclined toward arcane magic. Some hear the call of a deity, however, and become clerics instead. Dragonblood clerics focus on the elemental affinities of their draconic bloodline.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a dragonblood cleric substitution level, a character must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to take her 1st, 5th, or 9th level of cleric.

##### Class Skills

Dragonblood cleric substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Dragonblood Cleric Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+2|+0|+2|Turn energy|Same as cleric|
|5th|+3|+4|+1|+4|Energy barrier|See text|
|9th|+6/+1|+6|+3|+6|Energy sustenance|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the dragonblood cleric racial substitution levels.

**Notes**: The following substitution level class features require the dragonblood cleric to select one energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. The energy type must be the same for all these substitution features.

A half-dragon who takes one or more of these substitution levels must choose the energy type that matches her breath weapon (if possible). If a half-dragon cleric's breath weapon doesn't have an energy type, she can choose any energy type so long as it is the same for all substitution level class features.

A dragonblood cleric who doesn't take the 1st-level racial substitution level can expend turn undead uses in place of turn energy uses if she takes the 5th- or 9th-level racial substitution levels.

**Turn Energy (Su)**: Starting at 1st level, a dragonblood cleric can channel the elemental power of dragons to grant her and her allies [[protection from energy]] a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The cleric and all allies within 30 feet gain temporary immunity to the specified energy type. Each protected ally remains immune until the effect protects him from 5 points of energy damage per cleric level, after which the effect is discharged for that ally. If it is not discharged, the benefit of the effect fades after 1 minute per cleric level. The cleric can exclude herself and any allies she chooses from the effect.

Turn energy overlaps and does not stack with the effect of the [[resist energy]] spell. If a character is warded by both this effect and [[resist energy]], this effect absorbs damage until it is discharged. Turn energy stacks with the effect of the [[protection from energy]] spell.

This substitution level class feature replaces the standard cleric's turn or rebuke undead class feature. For a dragonblood cleric, turn energy counts as turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats, prestige classes, and so on.

**Energy Barrier (Su)**: A dragonblood cleric who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to create a wall of energy. This ability functions like the benefit of the [[Exhaled Barrier]] feat, except as noted below.

Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of energy damage per two cleric levels the dragonblood cleric possesses. If the cleric creates the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the cleric's class level + her Con modifier) halves this damage.

This substitution feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 5th level. From 5th level on, a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can prepare one less 3rd-level spell per day than shown on Table: The Cleric.

**Energy Sustenance (Su)**: A dragonblood cleric who takes the 9th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to gain the benefit of energy sustenance. The energy type selected for this ability can now heal the cleric.

To use energy sustenance, the cleric expends a turn energy use as an immediate action when she is subjected to an attack that deals energy damage of the specified type. If she does so, she heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the cleric to exceed her full normal hit points, she gains any excess as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour. When a dragonblood cleric uses this ability, she willingly fails any saving throw against the incoming energy effect.

This substitution feature replaces the 5th-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 9th level. From 9th level on, a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can prepare one less 5th-level spell per day than shown on Table: The Cleric.

#### Dragonscale Husk

Any warrior knows that skill in battle isn't enough; you must also guard against the attacks of your enemies. A well-forged suit of armor can mean the difference between life and death, but a warrior whose very body is his armor has an immediate advantage. Those who have the blood of dragons running in their veins can gain this benefit.

**Class**: Any standard class that grants proficiency in heavy armor, such as fighter or paladin.

**Level**: 1st (unless the class grants proficiency in heavy armor at a level other than 1st, in which case this feature can be taken only at that level).

**Special Requirement**: You must be of the dragonblood subtype to select this alternative class feature. As long as you gain the dragonblood subtype at the same level that you would gain heavy armor proficiency, you can select this class feature, even if you would normally choose class features before selecting the option that grants you the subtype. For example, a 1st-level human fighter who takes Dragontouched as one of his 1st-level feats could also select this class feature.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that profi ciency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that proficiency in order to select this class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick, scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours to grow, but this process can take place at night while you are sleeping.

Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the class that granted you heavy armor proficiency (+7 bonus to AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to AC at 6th level, and so on, up to a maximum +12 bonus to AC at 18th level). Multiple classes that grant this proficiency stack for determining the dragonscale husk's total bonus. This bonus doesn't stack with any feat, racial trait, or other special ability that would grant you a bonus to Armor Class.

In addition, as you attain higher levels, your husk grants you increasing resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. You gain resistance 5 at 5th level, resistance 10 at 10th level, resistance 15 at 15th level, and resistance 20 at 20th level.

Your dragonscale husk is treated as medium armor for the purpose of determining your speed and whether you can use class features or other special abilities. It allows a maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +2 and has an armor check penalty of -4. You can sleep in your husk without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while your husk is present.

Your husk isn't treated as armor for the purpose of being affected by spells or other abilities. You can't grant it an enhancement bonus with [[magic vestment]], nor can you imbue it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of armor.

You can't take off your dragonscale husk, but you can choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that crumble to dust if handled.

#### Drow Cleric

Everything you do, everything you are, is devoted heart and soul to Lolth: to spreading her power across the Underdark, and, of course, to cementing your own base of power among the drow. How better to honor the Weaver of Webs, after all, than to ensure that so potent and loyal a servant as yourself can direct her minions?

##### Master of Spiders

Spiders - the favored of Lolth and the totems of your race - respond to your call, bowing before you as they do before the divine mistress you both serve.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard cleric's ability to turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You can rebuke or command vermin as an evil cleric rebukes or commands undead. When commanding spiders, you gain a +4 bonus to your effective turning level.

This ability otherwise works exactly as rebuke undead. You can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for divine feats.

#### Dwarf Cleric

The dwarf cleric dedicates herself to her clan and the forge. She takes an active role in defending her people, often serving on the front lines of a battle. In exchange for greater martial ability and power when casting spells of the earth, the cleric gives up her ability to turn or rebuke undead and some of her spellcasting prowess.

**Hit Die**: d10.

##### Requirements

To take a dwarf cleric substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of cleric.

##### Class Skills

Dwarf cleric substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Dwarf Cleric Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+2|+0|+2|Smite giants|Same as cleric|
|4th|+3|+4|+1|+4|Hammer specialist|See text|
|8th|+6/+1|+6|+2|+6|Earthen spell power|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the dwarf cleric's racial substitution levels.

**Smite Giants (Su)**: A dwarf cleric who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can attempt to smite a giant with a melee attack, similar to the way a paladin smites an evil creature. She adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per cleric level. The cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Con modifier (minimum once per day). If the cleric accidentally smites a creature that is not a giant, the smite has no effect but still counts as one of the cleric's daily smite attempts.

This substitution benefit replaces the standard cleric's ability to turn or rebuke undead.

**Hammer Specialist (Ex)**: A dwarf cleric's dedication to the forge-god results in exceptional skill with the warhammer. A dwarf cleric who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency (warhammer) feat (if she doesn't already have it). She also gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when wielding a warhammer in melee.

This racial substitution level is only available to dwarf clerics who follow Moradin (or any other deity whose favored weapon is a warhammer).

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 2nd-level cleric spell than indicated on Table: The Cleric.

**Earthen Spell Power (Ex)**: A dwarf cleric who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level draws power from the earth when casting certain spells. When she is in contact with the ground, the cleric's effective caster level when casting spells with the earth descriptor (or any spell from the Earth domain, such as [[stoneskin]]) increases by one. This increase applies when determining level-dependent spell variables and on caster level checks. This increase stacks with other spell power abilities, such as from the hierophant prestige class.

This benefit replaces the 4th-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 8th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 4th-level cleric spell than indicated on Table: The Cleric.

#### Evangelist

Variably respected, scorned, or feared by other clerics, the evangelist has an intensely personal relationship with his deity. He has little if any formal training, and did not necessarily set out to serve a god; instead, his link with his deity developed naturally, not unlike a sorcerer's spellcasting ability. Evangelists have a narrower range of spells than a cleric, but they are capable of casting their spells spontaneously, with no need for advance preparation.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Class Skills

The evangelist's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local) (lnt), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (2 + Int modifier) × 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 2 + int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the evangelist.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The evangelist is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

**Evangelist Spellcasting**: The evangelist casts divine spells from the cleric spell list. His spellcasting ability is based on his Wisdom score. The evangelist casts these divine spells and gains spells known from the cleric list as a sorcerer casts arcane spells and gains spells from the sorcerer/wizard list. See the "Spells" ability of the sorcerer class for details. Note that the evangelist cannot learn a new divine spell in place of domain spells known.

**Domains**: At 1st level, the evangelist chooses two domains. He gains the granted ability of both domains, and he adds all the spells listed on the domain spell list to his spells known list at the appropriate levels (although he still can't cast these spells unless he is of appropriate level). The evangelist does not gain the cleric's ability to cast extra spells chosen from the domain lists.

#### Golarion Cleric

Some clerics think of themselves more as holy warriors than proselytizers or shepherds. For these clerics, the ability to fight trumps all other concerns. Taking the above ability requires a cleric to give up both of her domains, including her domain powers.

**Holy Warrior (Ex)**: A cleric with this ability is proficient with her deity's favored weapon. In addition, her base attack bonus as a cleric equals her cleric level, and her cleric Hit Die becomes a d10.

#### Improved Domain Powers

Clerics differ immensely in mission, role, and outlook depending on the deities they worship. No one would ever mistake a blood-soaked zealot of Erythnul the Many for a staid healer of Pelor the Burning Hate, for example. Cleric domains reinforce this notion, granting a wide range of specialized abilities and unique spells depending on a cleric's specific field of expertise.

Sometimes, even these specialized powers are not enough to truly define the differences in faith. A vicious cleric of Hextor and a valiant cleric of Heironeous might both share the exact same domains of Law and War, for example. The following rules present new powers attached to the core domains presented in the Player's Handbook. Many of these alternative powers go above and beyond the standard domain abilities and, as such, require the cleric to forego other abilities or take a feat.

##### Attaining Improved Powers

The simplest way a cleric can gain access to the additional powers of his domains is through the selection of the Improved Power feat. While other options exist, the DM must decide which possibilities he allows in his campaign and may add additional requirements as well, such as a sacred quest or special ritual. Some DMs might even choose to make these improved powers a boon granted to clerics who reach a certain level. While the feat and magic item options allow these new powers to be incorporated into an existing campaign, the other options are best if presented to characters at the start of a campaign.

_Feat_: The ability to use one of the improved powers represents deep devotion and time spent learning about one aspect of a deity. In this case, gaining access to an improved power is best represented by the Improved Power feat. Clerics who take this feat retain both of their granted domain abilities and choose domain spells normally.

**IMPROVED POWER [GENERAL]**  
Chose one of your domains. Through your long devotion and hours of study, you have unlocked one of the improved granted powers of that domain.

**Prerequisites**: Granted power of the same domain as the selected improved granted power.

**Benefit**: You may use the improved granted power of the chosen domain.

**Special**: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new domain.

  

_Magic Item_: Temples have long known the secret of forging special holy symbols that enhance the tie between a cleric and his deity. These rare and valuable magic items bestow the improved granted power while worn (see Devoted Symbol below). Clerics who wear one of these symbols retain both of their granted domain abilities and chose domain spells normally.

**DEVOTED SYMBOL**  
These rare holy symbols enhance the bond between a cleric and his deity, granting access to one improved granted power. Devoted symbols are tied to one specific domain and only grant the power if the wearer already has that domain and is a follower of the same deity. A devoted symbol of Vecna tied to the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain only grants the divine inspiration ability if the wearer is a cleric of Vecna with the [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] domain. Devoted symbols are worn around the neck, taking up the amulet slot, and can be used as a holy symbol for the purposes of turning or rebuking undead and as a spell focus.

_No Turning_: Some clerics never give a second thought to undead, as such monsters are outside the ethos of their figths. These clerics might wish for alternative uses for channeled divine energy. Instead of turning or rebuking undead, these clerics gain one of the improved powers associated with their chosen domains. They still gain both of the standard granted powers and may choose domain spells from either list as normal. The choice to use this option must be made when the first level of cleric is taken. The ability to turn or rebuke undead from other classes is not affected by this choice.

Paladins may elect to use this option as well, but must wait until 4th level to gain an improved power. As with turning undead, a paladin's effective level for these powers is that of a cleric three levels lower. A paladin must chose one of the domains associated with her deity, and if she has cleric levels the improved power must be from one of her chosen domains. A paladin with cleric levels cannot gain both improved powers through sacrificing the ability to turn undead from both classes. The choice to use this option must be made when the fourth level of paladin is taken.

_One Power_: Some clerics focus so heavily on one aspect of their deity that they develop powers beyond those of their brethren. Instead of gaining two granted domain powers, these clerics choose one domain and gain the improved granted power instead of either of the standard granted powers. When choosing domain spells, these clerics may choose from both domains as normal. The choice to use this option must be made when the first level of cleric is taken.

##### Improved powers

The following powers represent all of the domains present in the Player's Handbook. Other powers are certainly possible for domains from other sources. Unless otherwise noted, activating an improved granted power is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

##### AIR

**Far-Reaching Wind (Su)**: The touch of your holy symbol imbues a weapon with the essence of air. Air-imbued weapons are guided to their targets by gusts of wind, allowing supernatural accuracy over long distances. While under this effect, ranged weapons have their range increments doubled, and melee weapons may be hurled as thrown weapons with a range increment of 20 feet. Weapons enhanced in this way maintain their increased range for 1 minute. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

##### ANIMAL

**Totemic Spirit Companion (Sp)**: You can call upon the spirits of the natural world to aid you as a full-round action. This functions just like the spell [[Summon Natures Ally I|summon nature's ally I]] using your cleric level as the caster level. All creatures summoned in this way have either the celestial or fiendish template as appropriate to the type of energy you channel. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1). Additional uses of this ability may be expended to summon more powerful creatures, with each additional use spent increasing the spell to the next highest level. For example, a 6th-level cleric could use this ability to cast [[Summon Natures Ally I|summon nature's ally I]] three times per day or [[Summon Natures Ally III|summon nature's ally III]] once per day (or any other combination).

##### CHAOS

**Chaos Curse (Su)**: A forking beam of multicolored light springs from your outstretched finger and strikes an enemy within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. If your target fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier), it becomes stricken with random misfortune for 1 minute. Each round, the target has a 50% chance to drop what it is holding (if holding anything) or to provoke an attack of opportunity (if threatened and not holding anything). If neither condition applies, it falls prone. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### DEATH

**Call of the Grave (Su)**: Creatures near you feel the inevitability of death and resist attempts to keep them among the living. When activated, all conjuration spells of the healing subschool cast within 30 feet of you heal half as much damage as normal. In addition, spells that restore life, such as [[raise dead]], [[reincarnate]], and [[resurrection]] do not function when cast within 30 feet of you. You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.

##### DESTRUCTION

**Shattering Blow (Su)**: You may, as a free action, infuse your attacks with the destructive force of entropy for 1 round. While under this effect, your natural attacks and all weapons you use in melee are treated as adamantine for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction and object hardness. You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess and these rounds need not be consecutive.

##### EARTH

**Tremor Step (Su)**: While standing on a solid, natural surface (caves or fields would both work; the upper floors of a tower would not) you may strike the earth to produce highly localized seismic vibrations. All creatures except you standing on the ground within 20 feet of you must make Balance checks (DC 10 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) or fall prone. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### EVIL

**Torture Strike (Su)**: One living creature touched (requiring a successful melee touch attack) is wracked by agonizing pain, as if a branding iron had struck bare flesh. You gain a bonus on Intimidate checks against an affected creature equal to your cleric level for 1 minute. In addition, the target creature also takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and is nauseated for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) reduces the condition to sickened and negates the Strength damage. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### FIRE

**Flame-Guiding Song (Su)**: Your voice has a hypnotic power over fire. You can cause flames to lash out at those nearby, attacking one foe within 10 feet of an existing blaze. These hungry flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage and might cause the target to catch fire. The Reflex save DC to avoid catching on fire or to extinguish these flames equals 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. You may also use this ability to automatically extinguish nonmagical fires no larger than a bonfire. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### GOOD

**Saving Grace (Su)**: You can grant a divine boon to your allies, assisting them in their endeavors. You can bestow this boon upon an ally within 30 feet as a move action. This boon grants a sacred bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on the next saving throw, attack roll, skill check, or ability check he attempts within the next minute. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### HEALING

**Healing Light (Su)**: You may channel divine energy as a free action to enhance a spell of the healing subschool. When using this ability, such spells with a range of touch may be cast with a range of close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

##### [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]]

**Divine Inspiration (Su)**: You can glimpse into the mind of your deity, granting you unsurpassed powers of recall and intuition. You can channel divine energy to take to on any [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] skill check as if you had ranks in it, even if you are untrained, as a free action. You may add your Charisma bonus to the check in addition to your Intelligence bonus. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to you cleric level.

##### LAW

**Zone of Enforced Order (Su)**: You can emit an aura that makes chaotic creatures uncomfortable. When in effect, all chaotic creatures within 30 feet of you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.

##### LUCK

**Charmed Existence (Su)**: You may, as an immediate action, use this ability to gain a +2 luck bonus on an attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. You must decide to use this ability before you roll and may only use this ability once per round. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### MAGIC

**Power Magical Device (Su)**: You can channel divine energy through a wand, staff, or other charged magical item, powering it with faith rather than the item's own internal reserves. Doing so requires only as much time as is required to activate the item normally (typically a standard action). The magic item produces all its normal effects, but no charge is drained. To power an item, your caster level must be at least equal to the caster level of the item. You cannot use this ability to duplicate spells with an XP or costly material component. Abilities that require multiple charges require you to spend an equal number of uses of this ability. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### PROTECTION

**Shield of the Martyr (Su)**: You can prevent harm to others at the cost of your own safety. Whenever an ally within 30 feet takes damage, you can channel divine energy as an immediate action to split the wounds between the target and yourself (each taking half damage; if an odd number you take the extra point of damage). This ability can only be used once per round and only against a single damage source. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### STRENGTH

**Tremendous Might (Su)**: You can channel [[divine power]] into feats of truly superhuman might. You may add a +6 morale bonus on any Strength-based skill check or Strength check required to break, lift, drag, or push on object. This does not apply to attack or damage rolls, including grapple, sunder, or bull rush attempts. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

##### SUN

**Vengeance of Day (Su)**: Rays of light brighter than the noon sun burst from your raised holy symbol. All within a 30 foot cone must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) or be dazzled for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Undead and creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity, such as kobolds or drow, are blinded instead on a failed save. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

##### TRAVEL

**Second Wind (Su)**: You touch your holy symbol to a creature, imbuing it with renewed vigor for travel and great speed. You can remove the fatigued condition or make an exhausted creature merely fatigued. If the target creature has neither of these conditions, this ability instead increases the creature's base speed by +30 feet for 1 round. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

##### TRICKERY

**Miraculous Deception (Su)**: You can channel [[divine power]] to improve the skills you naturally develop in service of your trickster deity. Using this ability grants you a +4 divine bonus on a single Bluff, Disguise, or Hide skill check. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

##### WAR

**Piercing Steel Talon (Su)**: When wielding your deity's chosen weapon, you can channel divine energy into a single deadly blow. You instinctively attack the weakest points of your target's defenses, allowing you to, as a free action, ignore either the target's armor or shield bonus to AC for a single attack. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1), but no more than once per round.

##### WATER

**Waves Protect Their Own (Su)**: When at least waist deep in water, you can summon a vortex of swift currents and crashing waves to aid your allies and buffet your enemies. Allies within 30 feet suffer no penalties for underwater combat (as if under a [[freedom of movement]] effect) and suffer no risk of drowning in even the roughest seas (although if they choose to dive below the waves they can hold their breath no longer than normal). Enemies in the area take a penalty on attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier due to the impeding flow of the water (having a swim speed does not negate this penalty, although a [[freedom of movement]] effect does). You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.

#### No Turning

As any acolyte knows, the first divine skill taught to neophytes is the channeling of raw positive or negative energy through a properly prepared holy symbol. Most students talented enough to cast spells have trained in this ability to the point where it can drive away and even destroy undead - or when reversed, control them. Yet, not all such individuals learn to turn the undead. Some focus this divine energy to excel in their own area of expertise while others eschew the ability entirely in favor of more mundane skills. Such individuals embrace this difference, identifying themselves not simply as clerics, but with titles that reflect their specialties, such as warrior priests, theologians, or cultists.

##### CULTIST

You are secretly a worshiper of a dark god, plotting foul intrigues with others of your secretive cult.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. As long as you carry your holy symbol, you are immune to magical attempts to uncover falsehoods, such as [[discern lies]], [[zone of truth]], and similar effects.

##### EVANGELIST

You travel far and wide, making showy public sermons and seeking converts to your religion.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on diplomacy checks. An innate talent for magic grants you the following spell-like ability as a 1st-level caster: 2/day - [[comprehend languages]]. At 7th level, you gain the following spell-like ability as a 7th-level caster: 1/day - [[tongues]].

##### FANATIC

You are willing to die in the name of your deity, but you're even quicker to kill in his name.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. An innate talent for magic grants you the following spell-like ability as a 1st-level caster: 1/day - [[true strike]].

##### HEALER

You care most about curing the sick and injured, no matter whom they serve or what the circumstance.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks. Whenever you cast a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature other than yourself, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class and a +2 sacred bonus on Concentration checks to cast defensively until the end of your next turn.

##### JUSTICAR

The cleric of a deity of honor, justice, or truth, you seek to take prisoners alive for interrogation and fair punishment.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks. Whenever you deal enough damage to reduce a creature to negative hit points, the creature automatically and immediately stabilizes.

##### MYSTIC

Deities operate beyond the understanding of most men. So do you.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain an extra spell one level lower than the highest level spell you can currently cast. This extra spell is always one level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast, so when you gain the ability to cast a higher-level spell the level of the spell slot gained through this ability also increases.

##### RELIC HUNTER

Your church tasks you to hunt down and reclaim holy - or perhaps unholy - relics.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1). Additionally, [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) and Search are always considered class skills for you.

##### SAGE

The keeper of ancient truths and lores, you frequently study the antiquarian writings of your faith.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) checks. In addition, once per day, you may reroll a [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] check. You must take the second roll, even if it isn't as good as the original.

##### SCRIBE

After a career of scribing sacred doctrine and composing prayers, writing religious texts is second nature to you.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. In addition, the experience point cost to scribe a scroll is reduced by 25%, to a minimum of 1 XP.

##### SHAMAN

You are the wise elder and healer of a of a wilderness-dwelling tribe.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead and literacy (you are illiterate).

**Benefit**: You gain an animal companion as a druid of half your cleric level. Half your cleric levels stack with levels of any other classes entitled to an animal companion (such as the druid and ranger) for the purpose of determining your companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to you.

##### THEOLOGIAN

You are a wise and respected philosopher, frequently meditating to comprehend the nature of the divine.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) checks. As long as you conspicuously wear or carry your deity's holy symbol you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist divine spells, as well as the spells and spell-like abilities of outsiders.

##### WANDERER

Never staying in one plate for long, you travel the world on an endless religious quest, following the subtle signs and portents your deity leaves you.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (geography), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local), Speak Language, and Survival are class skills for you. You gain Endurance as a bonus feat at 1st level.

##### WARRIOR PRIEST

As much a soldier as a member of the clergy, you fight to protect your church, your fellow worshipers, and your ideals.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: Once per day, you may cast a quickened version of a spell you have prepared (that wasn't prepared as a quickened spell) targeting your weapon, shield, or armor. The spell's level does not increase because of this ability.

##### WEAPONMASTER

You have devoted yourself to the mastery of your deity's favored weapon.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: Turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on Craft (weaponsmith). As long as you wield your deity's favored weapon you no longer need a free hand in order to cast spells. Essentially, you substitute movements of your weapon for the somatic components of spells.

#### Peripheral Beliefs

Religions are steeped in dogma and traditions. The dogma of a religion almost always comes directly from the deities whom the religion reveres. Traditions, on the other hand, sometimes form for reasons that have little to do with the faith's deity. This article presents five sample peripheral beliefs, from which you may choose up to two. If a cleric violates a belief for any reason he loses its benefit until he receives an [[atonement]] spell.

##### DAILY PRAYER

At specific times of day, you must perform a prayer while facing a specific direction.

**Restrictions**: You must stop to pray at the appropriate times, regardless of your current situation. Most deities require at least three 5-minute prayers each day (dawn, noon, and sunset) but stricter lawful deities may also require prayers at mid-morning and mid-afternoon.

**Benefits**: Since you must always face the proper direction while praying, you can automatically discern true north as if you had 5 ranks in Survival. If you already have 5 ranks in Survival you gain a +2 bonus on all Survival checks instead.

##### DAY OF REST

Every seventh day, you must refrain from all physical activity, regardless of whether you are in town, on the road, or in the dungeon.

**Restrictions**: On the designated day, you cannot take attack actions, cast spells with somatic components, activate mechanical devices, or carry a load heavier than light.

**Benefits**: Due to being especially well-rested, you gain a +4 bonus on all saves made against sleep effects and you do not suffer a -10 penalty when making Listen checks while asleep.

##### DIETARY RESTRICTION

You believe a certain kind of food - such as all meat from a certain kind of animal or from any animal not slain in a specific way - is unclean. Any utensils or dishes used with unclean food themselves become unclean and taint any other food they touch.

**Restrictions**: Any food prepared by someone other than a devout follower of the religion, or any potion that is not created by the cleric, violate these standards of cleanliness. (A [[detect poison]] spell can detect these foods, since the cleric perceives such fare as spiritual poison.)

**Benefits**: Due to the careful choice of foods, the cleric is especially healthy and gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons and diseases.

##### SACRED ANIMAL

You consider some particular kind of animal sacred, such as cats, cows, or birds. You cannot harm or impede a sacred animal in any way and you must attempt to prevent others from harming or impeding one.

**Restrictions**: You cannot attack the sacred creature, even in self-defense. If your allies choose to attack such a creature in self-defense, you must ensure the creature survives, such as [[binding]] its wounds once it goes unconscious. If your allies are the aggressors, you cannot cast beneficial spells on them for 24 hours after the combat ends.

**Benefits**: Animals of the sacred kind feel a special affinity for you and instinctively avoid attacking you unless in self-defense or under magical compulsion (this benefit does not extend to your allies). In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with such creatures.

##### SACRED CLOTHING

You must wear some particular item of clothing that takes up a magic item slot, such as a head covering or a ceremonial glove, at all times.

**Restrictions**: Since the special clothing must be both worn and displayed as a show of devotion, you cannot cover up or remove it. This often means you must forego use of magic items that would be worn in that slot. It might also cause you to commit violations of etiquette in social situations.

**Benefits**: The special item of clothing is of masterwork quality and costs at least 25 gp. Wearing it grants you a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with other followers of your religion and it may be enhanced using normal magic item creation rules. A set of armor or other item that grants you benefits cannot count as your sacred clothing.

#### Planar Banishment

Instead of channeling energy to [[turn]] or rebuke undead, with this variant a cleric can channel energy to banish [[outsiders]].

Make a turning check as normal. The result indicates the most powerful outsider affected (treat an outsider as having Hit Dice equal to its Hit Dice + its Cha modifier, if any). if the roll is high enough to let the cleric affect at least some outsiders within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + cleric's class level + cleric's Cha modifier for turning damage. That's how many total Hit Dice of outsiders the cleric affects.

Any outsider affected by the turning attempt is banished back to its home plane. (If it is already on its home plane, there is no effect.) Even if it has the ability to travel between planes, it cannot do so for 10 rounds (1 minute). If the cleric has twice as many levels (or more) as the outsider has effective Hit Dice, he destroys any outsiders that he would normally banish.

If the cleric would normally turn or destroy undead, he has the ability to banish or destroy evil outsiders (that is, outsiders with the [[evil subtype]]). Characters who would normally rebuke or [[command undead]] instead gain the ability to banish or destroy good outsiders. As an additional option, the game master might allow clerics worshiping a lawful deity to banish or destroy chaotic outsiders, while clerics worshiping a chaotic deity could banish or destroy lawful outsiders. This ability would replace the ability to banish or destroy good or evil outsiders.

If you use this variant, consider allowing clerics who can turn or rebuke [[elementals]] (that is, clerics with access to the Air, Earth, Fire, or Water domains) to instead banish elementals of the same element and banish or destroy elementals of the opposing element.

This variant is otherwise identical to turning undead, including limits of daily uses and feats that enhance a cleric's turning ability.



#### Planar Cleric

Clerics who focus on the planes trade their ability to turn undead for control over extraplanar creatures. Outsiders view skilled planar clerics with awe or fear.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a cleric planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 4th, 7th, or 11th level of cleric.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Cleric planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the cleric's planar substitution levels.

**Planar Dismissal (Su)**: By selecting this planar substitution benefit at 4th level, a cleric trades away some of his power over undead creatures to gain the ability to dismiss a summoned extraplanar creature (such as a fiendish wolf brought by a [[summon monster II]] spell) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.

To attempt this, the cleric spends a turn/rebuke attempt and makes a level check (1d20 + cleric level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the summoner. If the summoning creature doesn't have a caster level, use its Hit Dice instead. The cleric gets a +2 bonus on this check if the summoned creature's alignment has at least one component opposed to his own (for instance, a lawful good cleric gets a +2 bonus if the creature's alignment includes either the chaotic or evil component, while a lawful neutral cleric gains the bonus only against chaotic summoned creatures.) Success indicates that the summoned creature is returned to its home plane.

Each attempt affects only a single creature, chosen by the cleric, that is within 60 feet and visible to the cleric. A cleric can't dismiss a summoned creature whose Hit Dice exceed his caster level + his Cha modifier.

A cleric who selects this planar substitution benefit reduces his cleric level by three for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a 4th-level cleric with the planar dismissal ability turns undead as a 1st-level cleric.

**Planar Domain**: A 7th-level cleric whose alignment is other than neutral can give up the two domains that he gained as a 1st-level cleric in exchange for a planar domain that matches his alignment (see Table: Planar Domains). The cleric need not worship a deity listed as one of the typical deities for the domain. A neutral cleric can't select a planar domain.

The cleric immediately loses the granted powers of his exchanged domains. Skills that were treated as class skills due to a granted power are treated as cross-class skills for this and all future cleric class levels (though the cleric doesn't lose any skill ranks for skill points already spent from previous levels). He can no longer fill domain spell slots with domain spells from the exchanged domains.

In return, the cleric gains a planar domain that matches his alignment, gains its granted power, and from now on may fill his domain spell slots with the spells appropriate to that domain.

**Table: Planar Domains**

|Domain|Required Alignment|
|---|---|
|Abyss|Chaotic evil|
|Arborea|Chaotic good|
|Baator|Lawful evil|
|Celestia|Lawful good|
|Elysium|Neutral good|
|Hades|Neutral evil|
|Limbo|Chaotic neutral|
|Mechanus|Lawful neutral|

**Planar Banishment (Su)**: By selecting this planar substitution benefit at 11th level, a cleric trades away his ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells of 6th level or higher in order to gain the ability to banish extraplanar creatures from his home plane. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell of 6th level or higher that is not a domain spell in order to cast banishment. (If the cleric loses a spell of 7th level or higher, calculate the save DC as if the banishment spell had been heightened to that level.)

  

**Table: Cleric Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4th|+3|+4|+1|+4|Planar dismissal|Same as cleric|
|7th|+5|+5|+2|+5|Planar domain|Same as cleric|
|11th|+8/+3|+7|+3|+7|Planar banishment|Same as cleric|

  

#### Pool of Healing

By sacrificing some of your personal power, you permanently establish a link to the Positive Energy Plane through your deity or belief system. The energy you draw from that plane obeys your direct command, and you can dispense it in the form of healing with a simple touch.

**Level**: 7th.

**Replaces**: To select this class feature, you must permanently sacrifice one of your 4th-level spell slots.

**Benefit**: You establish a pool of positive energy that you can use to heal yourself or others. This pool contains enough positive energy to heal an amount of damage equal to 5 x (1 + your divine caster level) hit points per day. As a standard action, you can dole it out with a touch, expending as much or as little of the pool at a time as you wish in much the same way as a paladin does with her lay on hands ability. The pool automatically replenishes every time you prepare spells for the day.

You can also deal out this positive energy with a melee touch attack against any creature vulnerable to positive energy (such as undead), damaging it as if you had cast a cure spell upon it.

For example, Jozan, a 7th-level cleric of Pelor, gives up one of his 4th-level spell slots to set up his pool of healing. Every day, he can heal up to 5 x (1 + 7) = 40 points of damage, or deal that amount of damage to creatures powered by negative energy, or use the energy for a combination of those effects, up to the maximum available. At 10th level, he can heal up to 55 points of damage using this ability.

Pool of healing is a spell-like ability.

#### Positive Healing

By imparting a portion of the divine energies he commands into an ally, the lightbringer cleric sustains his friend against injuries.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: One domain granted power.

**Benefit**: A lightbringer cleric can use one of his turn undead uses for the day to internalize the influx of positive energy and so gains fast healing 2 for 5 rounds. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Purple Staff Cleric

The Followers of the Purple Staff are a group of divine spellcasters trying to create a benign theocracy in the eastern part of the Dragon Coast. These clerics carry a great deal of political power within the borders of the so-called "Holy Realm" and use their magic to aid the citizens of their new land.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Purple Staff substitution level, a character must have Chauntea, Helm, Lathander, Nobanion, Selune, or Sune as his patron deity, be a member of the Fellowship of the Purple Staff, have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 4th, 6th, or 9th level of cleric.

##### Class Skills

Purple Staff substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Purple Staff Cleric Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4th|+3|+4|+1|+4|Spontaneous faith healing|See text|
|6th|+4|+5|+2|+5|[[Imbue with spell ability]]|See text|
|9th|+6/+1|+6|+3|+6|Turn invader|See text|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Purple Staff substitution levels.

**Spontaneous Faith Healing (Su)**: At 4th level, a Purple Staff cleric gains the ability to spontaneously convert prepared cleric spells of 1st level or higher to cast faith healing in the same way she can convert them to cure spells. Armed with this power, a Purple Staff cleric is easily able to deal with even the most severe injuries that common folk might suffer.

This class feature replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From this point forward, a Purple Staff cleric has one less 2nd-level spell slot than normal.

**[[Imbue with Spell Ability]] (Sp)**: At 6th level, a Purple Staff cleric can use an [[imbue with spell ability]] effect to imbue a creature with a single 0- or 1st-level spell she has prepared. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level. With this power, an adventuring Purple Staff cleric can leave nonspellcaster lieutenants in town to act on her behalf in emergencies or to spread out her spells to help defend a larger area (though she is not limited to these purposes, of course).

This class feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 6th level. From this point forward, a Purple Staff cleric has one less 3rd-level spell slot than normal.

**Turn Invader (Su)**: At 9th level, a Purple Staff cleric is so devoted to protecting his homeland that he can use his ability to turn undead to frighten enemies of the Holy Realm. When standing within the borders of his country, he can turn hostile monsters or enemies of the Holy Realm as a good-aligned cleric turns undead. He cannot destroy such creatures outright using this ability.

#### Rage Cleric

The deities of the core D&D pantheon span the spectrum of both alignment and temperament. Their clerics display equal variety when it comes to domain spells, customs, and codes of conduct. Why should a cleric of a wild warrior deity like Gruumsh or Kord equip himself in heavy armor, or even learn its use, when his barbaric flock enters battle with only fury and courage for protection?

The archetypical D&D cleric, with his mace and full plate displayed as prominently as his holy symbol, is as much a warrior as a spellcaster. In a similar vein, the rage cleric presents his divinely-inspired fighting arts just as proudly, although they take a very different form.

A rage cleric has the barbarian's rage ability. Although this greatly increases his melee prowess, it also limits his spellcasting ability in the heat of combat. The rage cleric's lower base attack bonus and d8 Hit Dice make him a far less effective frontline fighter than a barbarian, but if he prepares himself with spells beforehand he becomes a formidable berserker.

Most rage clerics follow deities who grant access to the Chaos, Strength, and War domains. On rare occasions, neutral clerics of lawful war deities adopt this class, but such wild warrior-priests walk a fine line between losing their deities' favor and capitalizing on their signature ability.

Rage clerics often begin their careers as barbarians, but at some point they experience a spiritual awakening that leads them down the path of the faithful.

Humans, dwarves, and half-orcs make up the majority of rage clerics. Elves, although chaotically inclined, usually lack the inner ferocity necessary to turn that chaos into a barbaric rage. Orc clerics, on the other hand, almost always adopt this variant class, which personifies the will of their barbaric deities. Many savage humanoids and lesser giants also favor it.

The rage cleric is a variant cleric. Unless otherwise noted, a rage cleric advances in the same manner as a cleric (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of cleric or rage cleric, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level cleric twice.

**Alignment**: A rage cleric cannot be lawful but must still be within one step of his deity's alignment.

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the rage cleric class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A rage cleric is proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Rage**: A rage cleric rages as a barbarian of equal level and gains the greater rage, indomitable will, tireless rage, and mighty rage class features as he progresses. Rage cleric and barbarian levels stack for the purposes of determining the number of times per day a character can enter a rage and the type of rage variant available.

In exchange, a rage cleric loses his ability to turn or rebuke undead as well as his ability to gain domains (which includes domain granted powers and domain spells).

##### Ex-Rage Clerics

A rage cleric who becomes lawful loses his rage abilities. However, provided that his deity accepts lawful-aligned clerics, he can continue to advance in this class and gain spells.

A rage cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his deity (generally by acting in a manner contrary to the deity's alignment or purposes) loses all spells and class features, except for rage and proficiency with light armor and simple weapons. He cannot continue to advance in this class until he atones (see the [[atonement]] spell).

#### Raptoran Cleric

The raptoran cleric gains extra powers from his dedication to the pact made between his race and the denizens of the Elemental Plane of Air. While not as combat-oriented as a typical cleric, a raptoran cleric can bring powerful servants of air to do his bidding.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a raptoran cleric substitution level, a character must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 7th level of cleric. A raptoran cleric must have selected either the [[Air domain]] or the [[Sky domain]] to select a raptoran cleric substitution level.

##### Class Skills

Raptoran cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard cleric class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Raptoran Cleric Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+2|+0|+2|Air mastery, empathy of the winds, turn or rebuke undead|Same as cleric|
|3rd|+2|+3|+1|+3|Air summoning talent|Same as cleric|
|7th|+5|+5|+2|+5|Open the wind-gate|Same as cleric|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the raptoran cleric's racial substitution levels.

**Air Mastery (Ex)**: Beginning at 1st level, airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a raptoran cleric.

This substitution feature replaces the standard cleric's heavy armor proficiency gained at 1st level.

**Empathy of the Winds (Ex)**: A 1st-level raptoran cleric gains a strong bond with air and its denizens. He learns Auran as a bonus language (in addition to the languages available to him because of his race and the Speak Language skill). He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks made to interact with natives of the Elemental Plane of Air. If he has the ability to bolster air creatures (such as from the Air domain), he gains a +4 bonus on turning checks made to do so. Allied air elementals within 60 feet of the cleric gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

**Air Summoning Talent (Ex)**: Beginning at 3rd level, a raptoran cleric can summon certain creatures of air more easily than other clerics can. Add the following monsters to the list of creatures that the cleric can summon with the appropriate summon monster spell:

_[[Summon monster II]]_: [[Air Elemental_Small|Small air elemental]]

_[[Summon monster III]]_: [[Mephit_Air|Air mephit]]

_[[Summon monster IV]]_: Medium air elemental

_[[Summon monster V]]_: Large air elemental

_[[Summon monster VI]]_: Huge air elemental

_[[Summon monster VII]]_: Greater air elemental

_[[Summon monster VIII]]_: Elder air elemental

This substitution feature removes all spells with the earth descriptor from the standard cleric's spell list. If a spell would only have the earth descriptor due to a particular version of the spell (such as a summon monster spell used to summon an earth elemental), the spell remains on the cleric's spell list but the version with the earth descriptor cannot be cast.

**Open the Wind-Gate (Ex)**: A 7th-level raptoran cleric can use the [[planar ally]] spells to call a more powerful air elemental than would normally be allowed. The cleric can call an 8 HD Large air elemental with lesser [[planar ally]], a single 16 HD Huge air elemental (or two 8 HD Large air elementals) with [[planar ally]], or a single 24 HD elder air elemental (or multiple Large and/or Huge air elementals totaling 24 HD) with greater [[planar ally]].

The costs associated with these spells remain the same. However, if any of the called air elementals die while in the service of the cleric, the cleric loses access to this ability for seven days and takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks during that period.

This substitution feature replaces the standard cleric's ability to call creatures other than air elementals with the various [[planar ally]] spells.

#### Rebuke Dragons

Though the destruction (or control) of undead is common to many divinely oriented characters, the deities also recognize the ancient power of the dragons as a primal force. Some reward their followers with the ability to instill such creatures with awe or command them as minions.

**Class**: Cleric or paladin.

**Level**: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

**Benefit**: You channel divine energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) dragons. This ability functions as an evil cleric rebuking undead.

It is more difficult to rebuke or command dragons that share your moral or ethical bent. Any dragon that shares one alignment component with you is treated as having turn resistance +2 against this ability. Any dragon that shares both alignment components with you is treated as having turn resistance +4 against this ability.

You can also use this ability to bolster a dragon against an attempt by another creature to use its own rebuke dragons ability (the same way an evil cleric can bolster undead against turning). To bolster a dragon, you must share at least one alignment component with the dragon.

An attempt to rebuke dragons counts as an attempt to turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for or activating divine feats, or for using other abilities that require you to expend a use of your turn or rebuke ability.



#### Spontaneous Domain Casting

After a while, clerics can start looking very similar. Even with a variety of domains to choose from, domain spells take up such a small portion of the average cleric's repertoire that they don't have much effect on the overall feel of the character. With spontaneous domain casting, though, your domain choice becomes a more important element of your character. You won't be able to provide as much healing to your party as a typical cleric, but the ability to prepare cure or inflict spells in your domain spell slots keeps you from falling too far behind in that area.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure or inflict spells.

**Benefit**: You can convert stored spell energy into the spells of one of your domains. Pick one of your two domains. You can "lose" any prepared spell (other than a domain spell) to cast any spell of the same level or lower on that domain list. Your choice is permanent unless an alignment change, deity change, or other dramatic event leaves you incapable of accessing the domain.

In addition, when preparing spells you can choose to fill any or all of your domain spell slots with either cure or inflict spells (depending on whether you would normally convert prepared spells to cure or inflict spells) of the same level.

For example, Crucius is a cleric of Heironeous with the Good and War domains. At 1st level, he chooses to spontaneously cast War domain spells. Thereafter, he can lose a prepared 1st-level spell to cast magic weapon, a prepared 2nd-level spell to cast [[spiritual weapon]] (or magic weapon), and so on. Furthermore, in each domain spell slot he can prepare a spell from the Good domain, a spell from the War domain, or a cure spell of the same level.

#### True Daylight

Lightbringer clerics, as befits their name, are capable of channeling divine energy in the form of pure sunlight.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: One domain granted power.

**Benefit**: A lightbringer cleric can use up one of his turn undead uses for the day to empower a daylight spell he casts with positive energy. The resulting daylight effect has a smaller radiance radius and a shorter, inconstant duration; however, the daylight created is the equivalent of daylight for the purpose of its effect on creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light (such as vampires).

The effect created by this ability sheds true daylight in a 10-foot radius and has a duration of 1d4 rounds (roll to determine each time this ability is used). This is an extraordinary ability.

#### Turning Presence

The standard rules for [[turn|turning]] undead allow a cleric to affect a relatively narrow band of undead (up to 4 HD greater than his cleric level). This makes many undead creatures "off limits" for this iconic power of the cleric. This variant changes the cleric's turning check into a battle of personality strength, representing it by a level check that also takes into account the opponents' Charisma scores.

When turning undead using this variant, the cleric makes a turning check against the closest creature first, followed by a separate check against the next closest, and so on. When two or more creatures are equally close, the creature with the lowest number of Hit Dice is affected first (if it's still a tie, the character chooses which is affected first). Creatures more than 60 feet away cannot be turned.

A turning check is a level check to which the character also adds his Charisma modifier. (Use the character's effective turning level, which is equal to class level for a cleric or class level -3 for a paladin.) The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit Dice + its turn resistance (if any) + its Charisma modifier. (To speed play, the game master can add a "Turn DC" score to the statistics block of each undead creature.)

If you use this variant, some creatures' turn resistance should be increased to keep them from being too easy to turn. Any creature with turn resistance of +4 or higher should gain an additional +2 to its turn resistance. Creatures with turn resistance of +3 or lower need no change.

If the check fails, the creature is unaffected. Its Hit Dice do not count against the total number of creatures the character can turn (see below).

If the character succeeds on the check, the affected creature stands frozen in place for 1 round, just as if it were [[paralyzed]] (though this affects even creatures with immunity to paralysis). On each succeeding turn, the character may take a standard action to concentrate on the effect, prolonging the effective paralysis for an additional round. (This doesn't count as a turn attempt, and affects all undead creatures that the character has "paralyzed" in this manner.) The character may concentrate on this effect for a maximum of 10 consecutive rounds, after which the undead creature can act normally. If a creature affected in this way is attacked or takes damage, the effect is broken and the creature may act normally beginning on its next turn. (The character's proximity to the creature has no effect.) This effect is the same whether the character channels positive or negative energy.

If the character's check beats the DC by 5 or more, he may instead turn the creature (if he channels positive energy) or rebuke it (if he channels negative energy).

If the creature has Hit Dice equal to one-half the character's effective cleric level or less, the turning attempt automatically succeeds, and he does not have to make a check (the creature's Hit Dice still count against the maximum). Furthermore, such undead are automatically destroyed (if the character channels positive energy) or commanded (if he channels negative energy).

The character makes checks against each eligible creature until he has affected the maximum Hit Dice worth of creatures, or there are no more eligible creatures. He can affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to three × his effective cleric level on any one turning attempt. For example, a 4th-level cleric (or 7th-level paladin) can affect up to 12 HD worth of creatures, which could mean two creatures with 6 HD each, four creatures with 3 HD each, or any other combination that adds up to 12 HD.

An evil cleric can instead channel negative energy to bolster undead or to dispel a turning effect. In either case, the cleric makes a normal turning check (if attempting to dispel a turning effect, add the turning cleric's Charisma modifier to the DC of the evil cleric's turning check. if the cleric successfully rebukes the undead, the undead gain turn resistance +2 (if he was attempting to bolster them) or are no longer turned (if he was attempting to dispel the turning effect).

For example, a 3rd-level cleric, faces three [[ghouls]] and a ghast. The cleric can turn up to 9 HD of creatures. Two of the ghouls are 10 feet and 15 feet away, respectively. The third ghoul and the ghast are both 20 feet away. His turning attempts affect the closest ghouls first, then the farthest ghoul, and then the ghast. The cleric makes the first turning check. A ghoul has 2 HD, but it also has +2 turn resistance, so it is treated as a 4 HD creature. After adding the ghoul's +1 Charisma modifier, the turning check DC is 15. The cleric rolls a 12, which, with his three cleric levels and +1 Charisma modifier, gives him a result of 16, so the nearest ghoul is halted in place. (If the cleric wants to maintain the effect, he'll have to continue to concentrate on it in later rounds.) He has successfully turned 4 HD worth of creatures, leaving him with 5 HD. This is enough to affect another ghoul, so he makes another turning check against the next closest ghoul. the cleric rolls a 6 against the second ghoul, for a result of 10, so the ghoul is unaffected. Against the third ghoul, his roll is 16 for a result of 20, which beats the DC by at least 5, so the cleric can turn the ghoul if he wishes to do so. Since he knows he can't affect the ghast on this turning attempt—it has 4 HD and 2 turn resistance, and the cleric has only 1 HD of turning left — he chooses to paralyze the third ghoul rather than sending it scurrying back into its burrow where it can gather more allies. (Even if the cleric had failed to affect the third ghoul, he would only have 5 HD left — not enough to affect the ghast thanks to its +2 turn resistance.) On his next turn, the cleric can choose to continue holding the ghouls in place or, if his allies have already destroyed the three ghouls, use another turning attempt against the ghast (which requires a DC 19 turning check).
