### ROGUE

<br><br>Rogues share little in common with each other. Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they share is versatility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what others don't want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, a guard's trust, or some random person's pocket money.<br><br>Rogues adventure for the same reason they do most things: to get what they can get. Some are after loot; others want experience. Some crave fame; others seek infamy. Quite a few also enjoy a challenge. Figuring out how to thwart a trap or avoid an alarm is great fun for many rogues.<br><br>Rogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack. Rogues have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can "fake it" well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.<br><br>Rogues follow opportunity, not ideals. They are more likely to be chaotic than lawful, they are a diverse bunch, so they may be of any alignment.<br><br>Although they are not renowned for their piety, most rogues revere Olidammara (god of thieves). Evil rogues might secretly worship Nerull (god of death), or Erythnul (god of slaughter). Since rogues are so diverse, however, many of them worship other deities, or none at all.<br><br>Some rogues are officially inducted into an organized fellowship of rogues or "guild of thieves." Some are self taught; others learned their skills from independent mentors. Often, an experienced rogue needs an assistant for scams, second-story jobs, or just for watching her back. She recruits a likely youngster, who then learns the skills of the trade on the job. Eventually, the trainee is ready to move on, perhaps because the mentor has run afoul of the law, or perhaps because the trainee has double-crossed her mentor and needs some "space." Rogues do not see each other as fellows unless they happen to be members of the same guild or students of the same mentor. In fact, rogues trust other rogues less than they trust anyone else. They're no fools.<br><br>Adaptable and often unprincipled, humans take to the rogue's life with ease. Halflings, elves, and half-elves also find themselves well suited to the demands of the career. Dwarf and gnome rogues, while less common, are renowned as experts with locks and traps. Half-orc rogues tend toward thuggery. Rogues are common among brutal humanoids, especially goblins and bugbears. Rogues who learn their arts in savage lands, however, generally don't have much experience with complex mechanisms such as traps and locks.<br><br>Rogues love and hate working with members of other classes. They excel when protected by warriors and supported by spellcasters. There are plenty of times, however, that they wish everyone else was as quiet, guileful, and patient as they. Rogues are particularly wary of paladins, so they endeavor to prove themselves useful when contact with paladins is unavoidable.<br><br>The rogue's role in a group can vary dramatically based on her skill selection - from charismatic con artist to cunning burglar to agile combatant - but most rogues share certain aspects. They aren't capable of prolonged melee combat, so they focus on opportunistic sneak attacks or ranged attacks. The rogue's stealth and her trapfinding ability make her one of the best scouts in the game.|

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the rogue.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

**Sneak Attack**: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.

A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies - undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and [[incorporeal]] creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

**Trapfinding**: Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a [[magic trap]] has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A [[magic trap]] generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A [[helpless]] rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Trap Sense (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught [[flat-footed]] or struck by an [[invisible]] attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

**Special Abilities**: On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.

_Crippling Strike (Ex)_: A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.

_Defensive Roll (Ex)_: The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll - if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

_Improved Evasion (Ex)_: This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A [[helpless]] rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

_Opportunist (Ex)_: Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the [[Combat Reflexes]] feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.

_Skill Mastery_: The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.

_Slippery Mind (Ex)_: This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.

_Feat_: A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.

#### Adventurer

The rogue who favors martial training over stealth and cunning can profit if she chooses her fights carefully.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Sneak attack.

**Gain**: Bonus feats (as [[Fighter]]).

#### Antiquarian

You are incredibly [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]]able about artifacts, relics, and antiques - especially those that are religious in nature.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the trapfinding class feature.

**Benefit**: When examining divine items and religious relics, you gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on all Appraise checks as an extraordinary ability.

In addition, if you examine a magic item created using a spell from the cleric or paladin list, or an item with special religious significance, you can attempt a [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion) check (DC 10 + the item's caster level) to identify it exactly as a spell-like ability. This works like the identify spell (caster level equals your rogue level) but requires no material component and can be performed as a full round action. You can use this ability on only one item per day.

#### Breathstealer

Rogues are among the best dragon hunters in the world, and they have developed a special attack to counter the powerful signature ability of these great beasts. Any rogue who expects to face dragons is advised to select this class feature.

**Class**: Rogue.

**Level**: 10th, 13th, 16th, or 19th. (You can choose this alternative class feature at any of the given levels.)

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard rogue's special ability granted at that level.

**Benefit**: If you deliver a sneak attack against a dragon, you can choose to sacrifice two or more dice of extra damage that you would normally deal to delay the creature's next use of its breath weapon. The delay is a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the number of dice sacrificed. If the dragon is currently recharging its breath weapon, this delay replaces the normal recharge time (usually once every 1d4 rounds) if it is longer.

Multiple uses of this ability don't stack; use only the longer delay. A dragon immune to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks is immune to this ability.

#### Changeling Rogue

The changeling rogue follows the natural proclivities of the race and its favored class, with most multiclass changelings beginning their careers as rogues in order to benefit from the class's wide range of skills. Though he gives up some of his adventure-oriented talents, the changeling rogue gains new abilities that aid him in more mainstream settings. Focusing on social deception and manipulation, he uses and shapes his racial abilities to strong advantage.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a changeling rogue substitution level, a character must be a changeling about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 8th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Changeling rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class, plus one [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] skill chosen when the first racial substitution level is taken. Once this selection is made, it cannot be changed.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 10 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Changeling Rogue Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+0|Sneak attack +1d6, social intuition|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+1|Minor lore +1, sneak attack +2d6|
|8th|+6/+1|+2|+5|+2|Mutable anatomy|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the changeling rogue's racial substitution levels.

**Social Intuition (Ex)**: A changeling rogue has an uncanny awareness of the tone of any social situation in which he finds himself. This grants benefits to a number of his skill checks.

- Making a Gather Information check to gain [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] takes a changeling rogue only 1d4+1 × 10 minutes, instead of the normal 1d4+1 hours.
- A gut assessment of a social situation with a Sense Motive check can be made as a full-round action instead of taking a full minute.
- A changeling rogue can take 10 on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks, even if stress or distraction would normally prevent him from doing so.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue's trapfinding ability. A changeling rogue without trapfinding can still use the Search skill to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, and can still disarm mundane (but not magic) traps with Disable Device, just as any other character without trapfinding.

**Minor Lore (Ex)**: Thanks to his varied personas and pursuits, a changeling rogue picks up bits of stray [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]]. Beginning at 3rd level, he gains a +1 bonus on all [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] checks (though this bonus doesn't change an untrained check to a trained check), improving by +1 every three levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th, and so on). In addition, whenever the rogue successfully aids another character's [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] check, that character can apply this bonus on his check result (in addition to the normal bonus granted by the rogue's aid another attempt).

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue's trap sense ability, which can never be gained at later levels.

**Mutable Anatomy (Ex)**: A changeling rogue learns to shift his body's anatomy in subtle ways during combat to avoid otherwise lethal strikes. Beginning at 8th level, any time a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a changeling rogue, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. If the changeling rogue has the ability to negate critical hits or sneak attacks by some additional means (such as armor with the fortification special ability), apply the chances separately.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue's improved uncanny dodge.

#### Criminal Specialist

A rogue (of other class that meets the following prerequisites) may specialize in one particular type of crime, much like a wizard might specialize in a school of magic. Such criminal specialization requires four mandatory skills and prohibits two other skills (the specialist can never put ranks into these skills, but he may still use them untrained). In addition, as long as the specialist takes an appropriate Skill Focus feat he also gains a unique special ability at the listed level, which he can use only if he maintains a maximum number of ranks in the listed skills (even if he multiclasses). Any class with all six of the listed skills as class skills qualifies and allows a member of that class to become a specialist in the listed field.

##### BEGGAR

As your childhood ended, the faces of those you implored for alms grew harder, causing you to learn how to feign injuries and infirmities, anything to stoke a charitable impulse. You have learned how to use those skills to protect yourself.

**Level**: 1st.

**Prerequisites**: Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Skill Focus (Disguise);

**Forbidden Skills**: Disable Device and Open Lock.

**Playing Possum (Ex)**: You may attempt to gain a temporary edge in combat by shamming a debilitating injury, such as blindness or a missing limb. This requires 1 minute of advance preparation, a disguile kit, and a Disguise check. The next intelligent foe you encounter must succeed at an opposed Spot check or else he is flat-footed against your first attack. Your first attack in the combat must be made against this foe. If you encounter multiple foes, they all get a chance to see through your disguise, but you only gain the benefit of this ability on the first attack you make.

##### BLACKMAILER

In your life you have developed a talent for remaining in the background while your targets committed their indiscretions. You can leap quickly into the foreground when you need to, taking your victims by surprise and using the threat of their secrets to cow them into obeying your forcefully delivered commands.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Prerequisites**: Decipher Script, Gather Information, Intimidate, Search, Skill Focus (Intimidate).

**Forbidden Skills**: Disable Device and Open Lock.

**Vilify (Ex)**: You can attempt to uncover some secret humiliation of a particular foe by carefully sifting through rumor and idle Speculation. You must spend at least 8 hours chasing gossip in an area your target has frequented within the last month followed by a Gather Information check (DC 10 + target's CR). If you succeed at this Gather Information check you may, at any time in the following month, make an Intimidate check against your target as a full-round action. At any time in the next hour, as long as you are not in combat, you may issue a command (as the spell) at your target as a standard action. The save DC of your command effect equals the result of your Intimidate check. This is a language-dependant, mind-affecting ability.

If your Gather Information check fails you must wait at least six months before trying again against that particular target. If your target simply has no humiliating indiscretions in her past (as determined by the DM) you cannot use this ability against that target.

##### FENCE

You learned to look for every defect in an item and never hesitate to use even the most infinitesimal flaw as grounds to lower your price. These skills proved equally useful when dealing with any kind of object, valuable or not.

**Level**: 6th.

**Prerequisites**: Appraise, Bluff, Forgery, Sense Motive, Skill Focus (Appraise).

**Forbidden Skills**: Climb and Tumble.

**Fracture (Ex)**: Your trained eye can identify and exploit the subtle, hidden defects of objects. After your first successful attack against a construct or object, you may make an Appraise check (DC 15 for an object or DC 15 + creature's CR for a construct). For every point by which you succeed at this check you can ignore one point of hardness or one point of DR for all later attacks against that construct or object. You can only use this ability with melee attacks.

##### GOON

You possess a singular enthusiasm for breaking legs - or heads - upon command, but you also learned to apply your intellect, to let rumor guide you to your targets and to find the kernels of truth within their pleas and evasions.

**Level**: 6th.

**Prerequisites**: Bluff, Gather Information, Intimidate, Sense Motive, Skill Focus (Intimidate).

**Forbidden Skills**: Decipher Script and Use Magic Device.

**Browbeat (Ex)**: You can, as a full-round action, make a single melee attack against an opponent. If you hit and deal damage, you can immediately follow it with an Intimidate check (DC 15 + target's CR). If you succeed in this check your foe becomes shaken until the end of your next turn. For each round you continue to attack the same target, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus on your Intimidate checks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

##### KIDNAPPER

Displaying a fiendish ingenuity for knots and bindings, you drifted into criminal gangs that made their living by snatching people and holding them for ransom.

**Level**: 1st.

**Prerequisites**: Climb, Disguise, Move Silently, Use Rope, Skill Focus (Use Rope).

**Forbidden Skills**: Diplomacy and Tumble.

**Hobble (Ex)**: You can attempt to restrict or bind any foe you manage to catch unawares. Whenever you face a flat-footed opponent no more than one size category larger than you, you may attempt a melee touch attack as a full-round action. You must have a length of rope at least 20 feet long in hand when you make this touch attack. If you succeed, you can wrap your target's arms and legs in rope. Make a Use Rope check with a -4 penalty. Your target moves at half his normal speed and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity scores until he escapes your knots, requiring a full-round action and an Escape Artist check (DC equals your Use Rope check).

##### LOOKOUT

While others spent their time housebreaking or shaking down tourists, you found a comfortable niche by merely offering advanced warning of approaching danger. Your keen senses made you a welcome addition to any criminal enterprise.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Prerequisites**: Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, Skill Focus (Spot).

**Forbidden Skills**: Appraise and Disable Device.

**Perceive (Su)**: As a full-round action, you can gain one of the following effects until your next turn: blindsense, low-light vision, scent, or tremorsense. You cannot gain an effect you already possess. This ability requires you to concentrate the entire time. If you are attacked or otherwise distracted, you must succeed at a DC 20 Concentration check or lose the effect.

##### PICKPOCKET

Through trial and error (and more than one night in jail), you mastered the art of taking what you needed from passersby - the fatter and wealthier the better. As you grew older, you learned the hard way that not all wealthy folk flaunted their jewels unarmed. After several lengthy stays at the local temples, you learned to identify (and disarm) those who carried protection.

**Level**: 6th.

**Prerequisites**: Hide, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Skill Focus (Sleight of Hand).

**Forbidden Skills**: Disable Device and Sense Motive.

**Snatch Weapon (Ex)**: You can attempt to strip a creature of a sheathed weapon by making a Sleight of Hand check (DC 20 + target's CR) as a full-round action. Your target must be flat-footed to you. You can snatch a light weapon (based on your size, not your target's) without penalty, a one-handed weapon with a -4 penalty, and a two-handed weapon with a -8 penalty. You cannot snatch a weapon too large for you to wield. If you succeed in this check, you gain possession of the weapon. You must have enough free hands available when you attempt the snatch to wield the weapon properly (i.e., you must have at least one free hand when attempting to snatch a light or one-handed weapon and two free hands when attempting to snatch a two-handed weapon). When you use this ability, your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot checks of those nearby. The success of observers (including your victim) doesn't prevent you from performing the snatch, just from doing it unnoticed.

#### Dead Levels

The rogue is the biggest offender of dead levels. Similar to the druid, the rogue is missing two special abilities out of twenty levels, but unlike the druid, the rogue has no spells to shore up these deficiencies. More unusual still is the distinctive lack of a crowning 20th-level ability to complete the class. As such, rogues can enjoy more significant dead level abilities than normal.

**Makeshift Tools (Ex)**: At 14th level, a rogue becomes so familiar with mechanisms and traps that the character can make Disable Device checks without a set of thieves' tools at no penalty. See [[#Disable Device]].

**Skilled Saboteur (Ex)**: At 20th level, a rogue makes quick work out of mechanisms and traps, disabling devices in one-half the normal time. See [[#Disable Device]]. A device that normally takes 1 round to disable now takes 1 standard action, allowing the character to make a move action afterward.

#### Death's Ruin

You can channel the power of your faith when making sneak attacks against undead.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature, including trap sense bonuses gained at higher levels of the rogue class.

**Benefit**: You can make sneak attacks against undead creatures. However, you roll only one-half your normal sneak attack dice (rounded down) when determining bonus damage for such attacks. This is an extraordinary ability.



#### Disruptive Attack

More than perhaps any other character, a rogue's ability to fully contribute to a fight varies dramatically based on the enemies she faces. Against a mummy, [[Golem_Flesh|flesh golem]], or [[shambling mound]], the rogue's damage-dealing drops precipitously. The disruptive attack alternative class feature allows a rogue to be effective in combat against such creatures by making them vulnerable to the attacks of her and her allies. It's also useful against creatures vulnerable to your sneak attacks, creating interesting tactical decisions for you in such fights.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain uncanny dodge at 4th level. Instead, you gain uncanny dodge at 8th level (when you would normally gain improved uncanny dodge).

**Benefit**: Beginning at 4th level, through careful study you're able to find exploitable flaws in any creature's tactics and defenses. Whenever you hit a target that is flat-footed against your attack, or whenever you hit a target that you flank, you can choose to sacrifice your sneak attack damage in order to apply a -5 penalty to that creature's AC for 1 round. Multiple hits on the same target don't stack. This extraordinary ability works even against creatures normally immune to extra damage from sneak attacks, such as undead.

#### Drow Rogue

Rogues are common in drow society, fewer in number only than clerics and wizards. They are silent killers, spies, and informants. It falls to them to gather intelligence about rival houses and to eliminate challengers within the hierarchy. For these tasks, drow rogues cultivate the ability to safely utilize poison.

##### Poison Use

Poison is used widely in drow society. For the dark elves, it is a vital tool in the race for survival. From the popular drow sleep poison to the bevy of spider venoms extracted from Lolth's favored creatures, drow have mastered a variety of toxins that wreak havoc with their opponents' bodies.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the trapfinding ability gained at 1st level.

**Benefit**: You are trained in the use of poison. You are never at risk of accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

#### Dwarf Rogue

Stolid dwarf society frowns upon roguery in its usual forms, but dwarves value two things in common with most successful outlaws: wealth and skill. Dwarven engineers, respected masters of their race's grand vaults and vast underground cities, sometimes feel the call of this combination to such an extent that they compromise their honor. Others learn engineering with the intent to destroy rather than create - to collapse tunnel ceilings on invading drow or burrow into the subterranean vaults of ancient foes.

A dwarven engineer learns to mix his mechanical aptitude with unconventional motives, finding ready employ with any adventuring party or thieves' guild he comes across. No one builds better than a dwarf, and no one can ruin better than one either.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a dwarf rogue substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Dwarf rogue substitution levels grant class skills as the base rogue class, plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (architecture and engineering).

**Skill Points at each Level**: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Dwarf Rogue Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+0|Demolitionist, trapfinding|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+1|Expert demolitionist, trap sense +1|
|5th|+3|+1|+4|+1|Rapid demolitionist|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the dwarf rogue's substitution levels.

**Demolitionist (Ex)**: A 1st-level dwarf rogue deals +1d6 points of damage against constructs and objects. This bonus does not ignore hardness or damage reduction.

This substitution replaces the rogue's normal +1d6 points of sneak attack damage at 1st level.

**Expert Demolitionist (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the rogue deals +2d6 points of damage against constructs and objects. This bonus does not ignore hardness or damage reduction.

In addition, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Craft, Disable Device, or [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (architecture and engineering) checks made to demolish, tunnel through, or otherwise degrade the structural integrity of an object or building - or to plan to do so.

This substitution replaces the rogue's normal +2d6 points of sneak attack damage at 3rd level.

**Rapid Demolitionist (Su)**: A 5th-level, the rogue deals +3d6 points of damage against constructs and objects. This bonus does not ignore hardness or damage reduction.

It takes less time for a rogue to use her Craft, Disable Device, or [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (architecture and engineering) checks in order to demolish, tunnel through, or otherwise degrade the structural integrity of an object or building - or to plan to do so. If the task ordinarily takes more than 1 minute to complete, it instead takes half as long. A 1-minute task requires only 5 rounds. Tasks that require a full-round action take only a standard action, and those that begin as a standard action only need a move action. A task that takes a move action or free action does not change.

This substitution replaces the rogue's normal +3d6 points of sneak attack damage at 5th level.

#### Feign Death

A clever villain has many contingencies in place, so that if a plan goes awry, he can beat a hasty retreat. In exchange for some ability to evade damage, he can enter a state that is indistinguishable from death.

**Class**: Monk, ranger, or rogue.

**Level**: 2nd (monk or rogue) or 9th (ranger).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability. If your class would grant you improved evasion at a higher level, you instead gain evasion.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can enter a catatonic state in which you appear to be dead. While feigning death, you cannot see or feel anything, but you retain the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around you.

While under the effect of this ability, you are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate you, such as [[raise dead]] or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and [[true resurrection]] immediately end your feign death ability.

Spells and other effects that assess your current condition, such as status and [[deathwatch]], indicate that you are dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) can discern that you are actually alive.

You can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though you still require food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.

#### Friend's Evasion

By giving up one of your high-level special abilities, you've learned to protect others by using your own skills and abilities.

**Levels**: 10th, 13th, 16th, or 19th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces improved evasion as one of the rogue's special ability choices.

**Benefit**: When you select friend's evasion as a special ability, every ally adjacent to you gains evasion. This is an extraordinary ability.

#### Golarion Rogue

Rogues trained in shadow-shrouded Nidal are renowned for their use of poison and other vile toxins to weaken and kill their foes. This ability replaces the trap sense ability.

**Poison Master (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the rogue can use poison without any chance of poisoning himself. For every three levels of rogue beyond 3rd, the DC for any poison coated on the rogue's weapons increases by +1 if the target is poisoned as part of a sneak attack.

#### Golden Hand of Vergadain

The Golden Hands of Vergadain defend the interests of the dwarves, particularly in areas of commerce and trade. Furthermore, the members of this organization work to eliminate threats to dwarven commercial ventures and recover goods stolen from dwarf merchants. The training provided by the Golden Hands helps members track foes of the dwarves and deal with them appropriately.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a Golden Hands substitution level, a character must be a dwarf, be a member of the Golden Hands of Vergadain, have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 2nd, 3rd, or 6th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

A Golden Hand of Vergadain has the same selection of class skills as a standard rogue does, plus Survival.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Golden Hand of Vergadain Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+1|+0|+2|+0|Evasion, favored enemy|
|3rd|+2|+1|+2|+1|Sneak attack +2d6, Track|
|6th|+3|+2|+4|+2|Urban tracking, track bonus +1|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the Golden Hands substitution levels.

**Favored Enemy (Ex)**: A Golden Hand of Vergadain can choose any organization in Faerun that opposes dwarves as a favored enemy, in the same way that a ranger chooses favored enemies. The Golden Hand gains a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against recognized members of the chosen organization, and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against such individuals. This ability cannot be used to "detect" members of the chosen organization, and it applies only against actual members. Thus, the Golden Hand cannot simply declare someone a member to gain the bonuses.

This benefit replaces the +1 bonus on Reflex saves that a standard rogue gains at 2nd level. From this point forward, the Golden Hand's Reflex save modifier is 1 point lower than that of a standard rogue.

**Track**: A Golden Hand of Vergadain gains Track as a bonus feat.

This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature that a standard rogue gains at 3rd level. Any time thereafter that the Golden Hand would normally gain an increase in the trap sense ability, he gains a +1 bonus on any check made to track instead.

**Urban Tracking (Ex)**: A Golden Hand of Vergadain can use the Gather Information skill to track targets in an urban setting. The tracking DCs and results are the same, but the skill used is different.

This benefit replaces the +1 base attack bonus that a standard rogue gains at 6th level. From this point forward, the Golden Hand's base attack bonus is 1 point lower than that of a standard rogue.

#### Goliath Rogue

Although the ponderous goliath might seem ill suited to the stealthy life of a rogue, tribes rely on rogue scouts to help them survive in their hostile environments. Goliath rogues embrace their people's toughness and durability in exchange for some of the rogue's traditional agility.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a goliath rogue substitution level, a character must be a goliath about to take her 2nd, 3rd, or 8th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Goliath rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class plus [[Survival]] (Wis).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Goliath Rogue Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+1|+0|+3|+0|Mettle of mountains|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+1|Sneak attack +2d6, wild sense +1|
|8th|+6/+1|+2|+6|+2|Fortification|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the goliath rogue's racial substitution levels.

**Mettle of Mountains (Ex)**: A goliath rogue who takes the 2nd-level racial substitution level has durability that allows her to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise harm her. She gains a +4 bonus on her Fortitude saves.

If the goliath rogue makes a successful Fortitude saving throw that would normally reduce a spell's effect, she suffers no effect from the spell at all. Only those spells with a Saving Throw entry of "Fortitude partial," "Fortitude half," or similar entries can be negated through this ability.

If the goliath rogue later gains improved evasion as a rogue special ability, her mettle of mountains ability improves instead. Now, while she still suffers no effect on a successful Fortitude saving throw against a spell or ability as described above, a failed Fortitude save results in the effect that a successful Fortitude save would normally bring about. For instance, a goliath rogue would take no damage from a [[disintegrate]] spell if she succeeded on her Fortitude save, and would only take 5d6 points of damage if she failed the save.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue's 2nd-level evasion ability.

**Wild Sense (Ex)**: A goliath rogue who takes the 3rd-level racial substitution level becomes more in tune with her natural surroundings. She gains a +1 bonus on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature) checks and Survival checks in aboveground natural environments. This bonus increases to +2 when the goliath rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th level, and to +6 at 18th level.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue's 3rd-level trap sense ability, as well as the higher-level improvements of the ability.

**Fortification (Ex)**: A goliath rogue who takes the 8thlevel racial substitution level develops a tough hide that allows her extra protection against potentially devastating attacks. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a goliath rogue with this substitution benefit, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue's 8th-level improved uncanny dodge ability.

#### Halfling Rogue

A halfling takes to life as a rogue as if born to it - a claim with which many other races would readily agree. A halfling rogue gives up some of her prowess in melee combat in exchange for increased talent with thrown weapons and an extra touch of halfling luck.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a half ling rogue substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 10th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Halfling rogue substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard rogue class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Halfling Rogue Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+0|Ranged sneak attack +2d6, melee sneak attack +0, trapfinding|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+1|Ranged sneak attack +3d6, melee sneak attack +1d6, thief's luck|
|10th|+7/+2|+3|+7|+3|Sniping mastery|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the halfling rogue's racial substitution levels.

**Ranged Sneak Attack (Ex)**: A halfling rogue is particularly talented at delivering sneak attacks with slings and thrown weapons. Whenever a halfling rogue delivers a ranged sneak attack with a thrown weapon or sling, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. However, her melee sneak attack damage is reduced by 1d6 (0 points of damage at 1st level, an extra 1d6 points at 3rd level, an extra 2d6 points at 5th level, and so forth, to a maximum of an extra 9d6 points at 19th level).

This ability doesn't give the halfling rogue the ability to deal sneak attack damage to creatures she otherwise couldn't affect (whether due to their anatomy, concealment, range, or any other reason).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace, the standard rogue's sneak attack ability.

**Thief's Luck (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a halfling rogue gains a second chance against certain dangers. She can reroll any Reflex save she has just rolled. If she chooses to use this ability (which must be decided before the result of the original save is known), she must abide by the second roll. She may use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every three levels gained thereafter. She can't use this ability more than once per round.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue's ability of trap sense. A halfling rogue with this substitution feature never gains trap sense from rogue levels.

**Sniping Mastery (Ex)**: A halfling rogue who has hidden at least 10 feet away from her target can make one or more ranged attacks, then immediately hide again as a free action. She takes only a -10 penalty on her Hide check to do so (rather than the normal -20; see [[Sniping]]).

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue's special ability gained at 10th level.

#### Holy Stalker

When you give up one of your high-level special abilities, you gain a link to [[divine power]] that helps you destroy undead. This divine energy comes to you through your religious beliefs but is tied to your own natural abilities in subterfuge.

**Levels**: 10th, 13th, 16th, or 19th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces crippling strike as one of the rogue's special ability choices. Only non-evil rogues can select this class feature.

**Benefit**: When you select holy stalker as a special ability, you can channel positive energy into your sneak attacks to damage undead creatures.

When you successfully damage an undead creature in a situation in which you would normally apply sneak attack damage, you add 2 points of positive energy damage per sneak attack die you would normally roll. This ability can be used in conjunction with [[#death's ruin]]. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Kobold Rogue

Kobold rogues pride themselves on their comprehensive understanding of trap dynamics. Trapmaking is an art, a passion, and a racial pastime. Many kobolds dabble in trapmaking, and kobold rogues who do so gain additional insights into dealing with such devices. Kobold rogues are notoriously cowardly and fragile, however, and greatly prefer stealth and retreat over face-to-face conflict.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a kobold rogue substitution level, a character must be a kobold about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 8th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Kobold rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class, plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (dungeoneering).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Kobold Rogue Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+0|Rapid retreat, shrewd trapfinding +2, sneak attack +1d6|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+1|Improved trap sense +2, shrewd trapfinding +4, sneak attack +2d6|
|8th|+6/+1|+2|+6|+2|Evasive skitter, shrewd trapfinding +6|

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the kobold rogue racial substitution levels.

**Rapid Retreat (Ex)**: A kobold rogue who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains the ability to retreat quickly from dangerous situations. Any time a kobold rogue with this substitution feature uses the withdraw action, she gains a 5-foot bonus to her speed.

**Shrewd Trapfinding (Ex)**: Starting at 1st level, each time a kobold rogue takes a substitution level, she gains a cumulative +2 competence bonus on Search checks to find traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm traps.

This bonus is lost if the kobold rogue does not have a number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to or greater than her rogue class level.

This substitution feature alters but does not replace the standard rogue's trapfinding class feature.

**Improved Trap Sense (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a kobold rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps. This is the same as the rogue's trap sense class feature, except that the bonus granted on Reflex saves and to AC is +2 instead of +1. A kobold rogue's trap sense continues to improve at the normal rate (to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 9th, and so on).

This extra bonus is lost, reducing the kobold rogue's trap sense bonus to the normal rogue value if the kobold rogue does not have a number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to or greater than her rogue class level. This substitution feature augments the standard rogue's trap sense class feature.

**Evasive Skitter (Ex)**: A kobold rogue who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to move out of the area of dangerous spells and effects. A kobold rogue who succeeds on a Reflex save against a spell or effect gains the normal benefit for the successful save, and she can choose to move out of the area of the spell or effect. She must take the shortest path available to her, and she can't move farther than her speed. If more than one path of equal distance is available, she can choose which path to use. If no such path is available, the kobold rogue can't use this ability. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for movement.

For example, a kobold rogue with a speed of 30 feet is within the area of a [[fireball]] spell. She successfully saves against the spell, so she takes no damage from the blast and can move out of the spell's area by the shortest route available.

This substitution feature replaces the standard 8th-level rogue's improved uncanny dodge class feature.

#### Lightbringer Strike

Creatures immune to sneak attack reduction are a bane to rogues everywhere. Particularly in ancient tombs where undead are common, rogues must rely on their wits to survive. You have spent significant time studying this problem and have learned ways to strike harm even these resilient opponents.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain trap sense.

**Benefit**: Whenever you flank a creature that is immune to sneak attack damage, you still gain half of your sneak attack dice as bonus damage. Note that this benefit does not extend to creatures that ignore your sneak attack damage because you cannot flank them. In addition, you still cannot gain sneak attack damage against such foes if they are flat-footed. You must flank a creature that is immune to sneak attack damage in order to use this ability.

#### Lunar Rogue

Lunar rogues call upon the essence of the moon to empower themselves, gaining the ability to rage and use a few moon-oriented spell-like abilities not normally available to rogues. This variant rogue gains all the class features of the standard rogue, except as noted.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a lunar rogue substitution level, a character must worship the moon and be about to take her 4th, 8th, or 10th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Lunar rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Lunar Rogue Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4th|+3|+1|+4|+1|Raging Rogue|
|8th|+6/+1|+2|+6|+2|Changing Rogue|
|10th|+7/+2|+3|+7|+3|Empowered Rogue|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the lunar rogue's substitution levels.

**Raging Rogue (Ex)**: At 4th level, a lunar rogue gains the ability to draw the moon's emotion into her, driving her into a rage, as a barbarian, once per day. This ability does not grant the rogue access to the greater rage, tireless rage, or mighty rage barbarian abilities, unless she also has the appropriate level in the barbarian class.

This ability replaces the standard rogue's uncanny dodge ability.

**Changing Rogue (Su)**: At 8th level, a lunar rogue learns one of the moon's secrets, gaining the ability to use either [[Invisibility Greater|greater invisibility]] or [[Compendium/Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]] as a spell-like ability once per day (choose one - you cannot later change your selection). This ability may only target the lunar rogue. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to her rogue class level.

This ability replaces the standard rogue's improved uncanny dodge ability.

**Empowered Rogue (Su)**: At 10th level, a lunar rogue discovers the moon's true power and gains the ability to use either [[dominate person]] or [[true seeing]] as a spell-like ability once per day (choose one - you cannot later change your selection). The [[true seeing]] ability may only target the lunar rogue. The caster level for this spell-like ability equals her rogue class level. A saving throw against the [[dominate person]] has a DC of 10 + 1/2 the rogue's class level + her Charisma modifier.

This ability replaces the standard rogue's special ability at 10th level. Additional special abilities gained by a rogue after 10th level are treated as normal.

#### Mimic

Many villains specialize in avoiding detection so that they can work behind the scenes to achieve their nefarious goals. To this end, they spend a fair amount of time developing techniques to mask their appearance, at the expense of their normal training in foiling traps.

**Class**: Rogue.

**Level**: 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th.

**Special Requirement**: You must have a Charisma of 12 or higher to select this alternative class feature.

**Replaces**: If you select this feature, you do not gain the trapfinding ability.

**Benefit**: Once per day, you can use [[disguise self]] as a caster whose level equals your class level. At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, you can reduce your bonus on trap sense by 1 to gain an additional use of mimic.

At your discretion, when using [[disguise self]], you can spend two uses of the spell-like ability to produce the effect as a swift action rather than a standard action.

#### Penetrating Strike

Creatures that have immunity to extra damage from sneak attacks are a bane to rogues everywhere. Particularly in ancient tombs where undead are common, rogues must rely on their wits to survive. You have spent a significant amount of time studying this problem and have learned ways to harm even such resilient opponents.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain trap sense.

**Benefit**: Whenever you flank a creature that is immune to extra damage from sneak attacks, you still deal extra damage equal to half your normal sneak attack dice. This benefit does not apply against creatures that cannot be flanked, nor against foes that are otherwise denied their Dexterity bonus to AC or flat-footed but not flanked.

#### Planar Rogue

The only thing more varied and unpredictable than a rogue's intentions are the infinite planes of reality. No matter what a rogue wants to do, no matter what treasure or information or experience she seeks, it can be found somewhere on the planes.

A rogue who spends her life exploring the twisting realities and the gossamer walls that separate them comes away with a unique insight into the way the cosmos functions. She may not have a scholar's ability to understand it, nor a poet's skill to describe it, but the rogue has something eminently more useful - she knows the loopholes built into the laws of reality and how to bend them ever so slightly to her advantage.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a rogue planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 6th, 10th, or 16th level of rogue.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Rogue planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Rogue Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|6th|+4|+2|+5|+2|Breach sense|
|10th|+7/+2|+3|+7|+3|Slip the bonds|
|16th|+12/+7/+2|+5|+10|+5|[[Blink]]|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the rogue's planar substitution levels.

**Breach Sense (Ex)**: A 6th-level planar rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her of the imminent opening of a nearby conduit between the planes. She automatically detects the activation of any portal or the opening of any planar breach within 30 feet of her, as well as any spell or effect that crosses over or through the planes (such as summon monster, [[teleport]], or [[plane shift]]) used within 30 feet of her. The rogue may immediately attempt a DC 25 Spot check to pinpoint the exact location of the portal, breach, or effect, as long as she has line of sight to it.

For example, a planar rogue would detect a demon teleporting to a spot within 30 feet of her, and with a DC 25 Spot check could even pinpoint the precise location where the demon appeared (though she would lose this precision as soon as the demon moved).

This benefit replaces the improvement to the trap sense class feature gained by a standard rogue at 6th level. From now on, whenever the rogue gains a standard rogue level that grants an improvement to her trap sense, she gains the indicated bonus minus 1 (trap sense +2 at 9th level, trap sense +3 at 12th level, and so on).

**Slip the Bonds (Su)**: A rogue who chooses this substitution benefit at 10th level knows how to slip momentarily into the periphery of the plane she is on. Once per day as a free action, she can turn ethereal for a single round.

This benefit replaces the special ability gained by a standard rogue at 10th level.

**[[Blink]] (Sp)**: By 16th level, a planar rogue's understanding of how to skirt the periphery of a plane is such that she can use a [[blink]] effect on herself once per day. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level (rounded down).

This benefit replaces the special ability gained by a standard rogue at 16th level.

#### Quick Fingers

Sometimes only a few seconds make the difference between stopping the descent of a spiked ceiling and coming to a messy end. Through countless hours of practice, you have learned to make quick work of traps. But this speed comes at a price. Because you focus on disarming traps, you react more slowly when a trap activates.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain trap sense +1 at 3rd level. Instead, you gain trap sense +1 at 6th level, with an additional increase of +1 every four levels thereafter (to a maximum of +4 at 18th level).

**Benefit**: When you use Disable Device to disarm a trap, the time required to perform the check is reduced. Use the following table in place of the one on the [[#Disable Device]] skill description.

|Device|Time|Disable Device DC|
|---|---|---|
|Simple|1 move action|10|
|Tricky|1 standard action|15|
|Difficult|1 full-round action|20|
|Wicked|1d4 rounds|25+|

  

#### Rilkan Rogue

A rilkan rogue is typically a silver-tongued trickster or charlatan, or perhaps simply a charismatic daredevil. She relies on personality and passion for adventure to win the day. Despite her considerable talents of interaction and deception, though, she is quite capable of holding her own in a fight - all the better to survive the anger of a deceived merchant or a spurned suitor.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a rilkan rogue substitution level, a character must be a rilkan about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 10th level of rogue.

##### Class Skills

Rilkan rogue substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard rogue class, plus Speak Language.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Rilkan Rogue Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+0|Trapfinding, improved flanking|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+1|Sneak attack +1d6, bardic [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]], bonus feat|
|10th|+7/+2|+3|+7|+3|Fortunate reflexes|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the rilkan rogue racial substitution levels.

**Improved Flanking (Ex)**: A rilkan rogue who is flanking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on attacks instead of a +2 bonus on attacks. Any other rilkans flanking the same opponent also benefit from this improved bonus. Other, nonrilkan characters flanking with the rilkan rogue don't gain this increased bonus.

This benefit replaces a standard rogue's sneak attack ability gained at 1st level. Instead, a rilkan rogue gains sneak attack at 3rd level and reduces the extra damage dice indicated by 1d6.

**Bardic [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (Ex)**: A rilkan rogue picks up a lot of stray [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] while interacting with others. Starting at 3rd level, she can make a special bardic [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] check with a bonus equal to her rogue level plus her Intelligence modifier to see whether she knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or significant places. This is otherwise identical to the bard's class feature of the same name.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue's trap sense class feature gained at 3rd level. A rilkan rogue who selects this substitution feature never gains trap sense from her rogue levels.

**Bonus Feat**: At 3rd level, a rilkan rogue selects one of the following feats as a bonus feat: Deceitful, Diligent, Investigator, Negotiator, or Persuasive.

**Fortunate Reflexes (Ex)**: A rilkan rogue enjoys living life on the edge, taking risks that other rogues might avoid. Beginning at 10th level, a rilkan rogue can choose to reroll any failed Reflex save. The rogue must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. If the original roll is a natural 1, the rilkan rogue can't use this ability.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue's special ability gained at 10th level. Furthermore, a rilkan rogue forever forfeits the ability to gain improved evasion as a rogue class feature. (She can still gain improved evasion from some other source.)

#### Special Abilities

As rogues hone their skills they sometimes discover new, almost supernatural ways to manifest their talents. Presented here are several new options for rogue special abilities. Rogues have the option to choose their special abilities at higher levels, and the options in this article are similar to those already outlined in the rogue's description.

_Accurate Fall (Ex)_: Dancing upon currents and eddies in the air the rogue may aim where she falls, often managing to land in just the right spot to minimize injury. Whenever the rogue falls she may attempt a Reflex save to convert half the damage from the fall into nonlethal damage. The DC of the save depends upon the type of surface upon which the rogue falls.

|Surface|DC|
|---|---|
|Liquid (water, quicksand)|18|
|Soft (lava, mud, haystack)|20|
|Yielding (underbrush, tent canopy)|22|
|Hard (stone, building roof)|24|
|Uneven (spikes, stalagmites)|26|

The rogue may also make a Tumble check in order to reduce the lethal damage further.

Prerequisite: Must have survived taking 20d6 points of damage from falling.

_Adrenaline Rush (Ex)_: Brought to the brink of death by massive trauma the rogue somehow survived. As a result, she developed a talent for pushing her body beyond its normal limits. Once per day, the rogue may choose to treat a Strength-based skill check as if she had rolled a natural 20. The rogue must declare she is using this ability before the die roll, thereby negating the necessity of the check.

Prerequisite: Must have succeeded at a Fortitude save to avoid death due to massive damage.

_Cartilaginous Skeleton (Ex)_: The rogue's shattered bones knit back together under a sheath of flexible cartilage, allowing her to contort herself in remarkable ways. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on Escape Artist checks and an additional +2 bonus when at tempting to escape a grapple. Further, if subject to a grapple she may make an attack of opportunity against the grappling opponent even if it has the Improved Grapple feat or the improved grab special attack.

Prerequisite: Must have been reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by bludgeoning damage or a crushing attack.

_Enriched Bone Marrow (Ex)_: The rogue's recovery from near-fatal blood loss left her better able to recuperate from physical disability. Each day in which the rogue attempts to recover ability damage to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, she may attempt a Fortitude save (DC 15 + current amount of ability damage) to recover an extra point of ability damage.

Prerequisite: Constitution must have been reduced below 3 by blood-draining attacks.

_Façade (Ex)_: When the rogue disguises himself, he delves so deeply into character that he fools even divination magic. Whenever a creature casts a divination spell (or uses an ability that reproduces the effect of such a spell) that affects the rogue while he's disguised, the creature must make a Spot check opposed by the rogue's Disguise check. If the Spot check fails, the divination spell perceives the rogue as radiating the aura and thoughts that the rogue wishes the effect to detect. For instance, a rogue disguised as a [[zombie]] might radiate a neutral evil aura, detect as undead, and would have no discernible thoughts for a [[detect thoughts]] spell to pick up. Such a rogue would not suffer any ill effects from such a perfect disguise, such as extra harm from a holy or bane weapons.

_Face in the Crowd (Ex)_: The rogue develops an uncanny ability to blend in while among large numbers of people. When within a crowd, the rogue may use the Hide skill even while being observed. For the purposes of this effect, a crowd consists of at least ten creatures at least half the rogue's size within a 10-foot radius of the rogue.

_Fear Mirror (Su)_: Having faced and overcome the most terrifying thing she can imagine, the rogue may reflect similar horrors back at her foes. When targeted by a fear effect the rogue instinctively projects the attack back to its source. Both the rogue and the source of the fear effect must make any applicable saving throws to resist the effects of the attack. Any immunities possessed by the source of the attack still apply.

Prerequisite: Must have succeeded at a Fortitude save to resist [[phantasmal killer]].

_Frostfell Terrain Mastery (Ex)_: The rogue can move about in frostfell environments with great ease and quickness. As long as she is in a cold terrain or region of frostfell (or in a city located in such a region), the rogue gains a +2 competence bonus on initiative checks and a +10-foot bonus to her land speed. She loses these bonuses when she is wearing medium or heavy armor, or is carrying a medium or heavy load.

_Handwriting Analysis (Ex)_: Trained to scrutinize the whorls and loops of a person's writing along with choices of words and imagery, the rogue may make startlingly accurate deductions about a person from handwriting alone. Upon making a successful Decipher Script check, the rogue may attempt to learn further information about the writer. The result of this Decipher Script check reveals specific traits and all facts of a lesser DC as noted in the following table. For example, a rogue who makes a Decipher Script check and exceeds the DC by 5 reveals the relative age, race, and gender of the writer.

When attempting to use this ability to sniff out a forgery (for instance, to see if a love letter purportedly written by a princess was actually composed by a female of her age, race, and gender) use the Forgery skill check of the forger in lieu of a Decipher Script DC. By succeeding at a Decipher Script check opposed by the forger's Forgery check, the rogue may attempt to reveal information about the forger as normal.

|Fact|Decipher Script Check|
|---|---|
|Gender|Meets DC|
|Race|Exceeds the DC by 2|
|Relative age*|Exceeds the DC by 5|
|Highest level class|Exceeds the DC by 10|
|Law vs. chaos alignment axis|Exceeds the DC by 15|
|Good vs. evil alignment axis|Exceeds the DC by 20|
|* _Child, adult, middle aged, old, or venerable._|   |

_Happier Days (Ex)_: At the moment of crisis the rogue's life did indeed pass before her eyes, and now she may draw upon memories of better times to sustain her when enemies assault her psyche. Once per day, if the rogue must attempt a Will save she may instead choose to cast her mind adrift among her memories rather then suffer the effects of a possible failed save. She must decide to use this ability before she attempts the Will save, negating the need for the saving throw. While lost in her memories she is oblivious to her surroundings and becomes helpless. Each round, at the end of her turn, the rogue may attempt to pull her thoughts back to the present attempting a Will save (at the same DC of the original Will save). For each round she fails this save she remains helpless.

Prerequisite: Must have made a saving throw to resist a death effect.

_Heart of Stone (Ex)_: A brush with petrification left the rogue's organs stronger and more resilient, offering her protection from certain kinds of injuries. The rogue gains DR 5/-, but only against the extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, the rogue adds her class level to the amount of damage required to trigger a Fortitude save to resist death due to massive damage.

Prerequisite: Must have successfully resisted a petrification attack.

_Ice in the Veins (Ex)_: Intense cold brings with it a strange lethargy and somehow, to the detriment of her enemies, the experience lingers within the rogue's bloodstream. Any creature not immune to cold or sleep effects that bites the rogue must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the rogue's class level + the rogue's Constitution modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round per 2 rogue class levels. Once affected by this ability, further bites extend the duration but do not otherwise stack.

Prerequisite: Must have been reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by a cold attack.

_Knockout Blow (Ex)_: When a rogue would make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage, she may instead attempt to stun her opponent before rolling her attack. If she hits, her opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15 + per die of sneak attack damage) or be stunned for 1d3 rounds.

_Light Sleeper (Ex)_: The rogue's sensitivity to the slightest sound becomes so acute that it is almost impossible for him to fail to react to danger. The rogue no longer suffers a -10 penalty to Listen checks while asleep.

_Painful Strike_: The rogue's [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] of anatomy allows her to inflict tremendous pain. The rogue must make a sneak attack attempt with an unarmed strike. If she hits, her target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per die of sneak attack damage + Intelligence modifier). If the target fails this save, he must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + 1 per die of sneak attack damage + spell level) to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability for the next 1d6 rounds. The target suffers only normal damage for the unarmed strike, not sneak attack damage, when a rogue uses this ability.

_Rainbow Stare (Su)_: Somehow, while enduring a nearly overwhelming array of colors and light the rogue learned how to screen out dangerous images. She gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against figments and glamers and is completely immune to patterns.

Prerequisite: Must have survived passing through at least four layers of either a [[prismatic sphere]] or a prismatic wail.

_Saboteur (Ex)_: The rogue's perception becomes so honed that he instantly notices even the most minute flaws in objects, enabling him to strike at their vulnerable points. When attacking objects or making a sunder attack action, the rogue may ignore an amount of hardness up to half his rogue class level. Further, constructs are no longer immune to the rogue's sneak attacks.

_Swift Kick (Ex)_: Effortlessly examining mechanical devices, the rogue may affect them with a vigorous jolt. The rogue no longer needs tools to use the Disable Device skill (although he still gains the +2 circumstance bonus when using masterwork thieves' tools). In addition, the time it takes the rogue to use the Disable Device skill is reduced by one step. Difficult and wicked devices now require 1d4 rounds to disable, tricky devices require 1 round, and a simple device can be disabled as a free action.

_Toxic Blood (Ex)_: A permanent residue of poison courses through the rogue's veins. Any creature not immune to poison that bites the rogue must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the rogue's class level + the rogue's Constitution modifier) or immediately take 1 point of Constitution damage. Once triggered, this ability does not function again for 1 hour.

Prerequisite: Constitution must have been reduced below 3 by poison.



#### Spell Reflection

Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.

**Class**: Monk, ranger, rogue, or scout.

**Level**: 2nd (monk or rogue), 5th (scout), or 9th (ranger).

**Special Requirement**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)

**Benefit**: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability.

For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a [[scorching ray]], you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the [[scorching ray]] deals its normal damage to the wizard.

This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren't subject to this reflection.

If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as [[scorching ray]] cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard's [[scorching ray]] spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).

#### Spell Sense

Most barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger, whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap. Some, however, fine-tune this ability to focus on magical attacks, granting them the ability to dodge the orbs, rays, and eldritch blasts of their enemies.

**Class**: Barbarian or rogue.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Special Requirement**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain the trap sense class feature (or any later improvements to that class feature).

**Benefit**: Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every three barbarian or rogue levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and so on to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This is an extraordinary ability.

#### Uncanny Bravery

Many barbarian tribes revere dragons, while others see them as akin to natural disasters. Regardless, some barbarians learn to steel themselves against the bloodcurdling fear that these great beasts can create in weak-minded targets.

This ability also benefits rogues who try to plunder dragon hoards. Although they hope to complete the task without awakening the dragon, only the truly stupid fail to plan for such a possibility.

**Class**: Barbarian or rogue.

**Level**: 5th (barbarian) or 8th (rogue).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain improved uncanny dodge.

**Benefit**: You are immune to the frightful presence of dragons. You gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against all other forms of fear.

#### Wilderness Rogue

The wilderness rogue prefers to put her skills to use in the great outdoors, rather than in cramped alleys and dungeon corridors. In many ways, she is similar to the traditional ranger, though with less combat savvy and with none of the ranger's divine link to the natural world.

##### Class Skills

Remove the following rogue class skills from the wilderness rogue's class skill list: [[Appraise]], [[Diplomacy]], [[Decipher Script]], [[Forgery]], and [[Gather Information]].

Add the following skills to the wilderness rogue's class skill list: [[Handle Animal]], [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (geography), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature), [[Ride]], and [[Survival]].

##### Class Features

The wilderness rogue has all the standard rogue class features, except as noted below.

**Special Abilities**: Add woodland stride (as the 7th-level [[ranger]] ability), camouflage (as the 13th-level [[ranger]] ability), and hide in plain sight (as the 17th-level [[ranger]] ability, requires the rogue to already have the camouflage ability) to the list of special abilities that can be chosen by the wilderness rogue.
