###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Fast Movement (Ex)**: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.

**Illiteracy**: Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak. A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.

**Rage (Ex)**: A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for [[Balance]], [[Escape Artist]], [[Intimidate]], and [[Ride]]), the [[Concentration]] skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except [[Combat Expertise]], [[item creation feats]], and [[metamagic feats]]. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes [[fatigued]] (–2 penalty to Strength, –2 penalty to Dexterity, can't [[charge]] or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).  
A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught [[flat-footed]] or struck by an [[invisible]] attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

**Trap Sense (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.

**Damage Reduction (Ex)**: At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

**Greater Rage (Ex)**: At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at –2.

**Indomitable Will (Ex)**: While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.

**Tireless Rage (Ex)**: At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes [[fatigued]] at the end of his rage.

**Mighty Rage (Ex)**: At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at –2.

###### Ex-Barbarians

A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).

#### Aquatic Barbarian


**Fast Movement (Ex)**: Barbarians who possess a racial swim speed can choose to apply their [[#fast movement]] bonus to their swim speed instead of their land speed. The choice must be made when the character gains the class feature and cannot be changed later. This benefit still applies only when the barbarian is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.



#### Berserker Strength

The decision of when to rage is one of the toughest faced by a barbarian. Selecting the berserker strength class feature in place of rage removes the need for this often complicated tactical decision, replacing it with an automatically activated boost to your combat prowess and durability. In short, when the going gets tough, you get tougher.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain [[#rage]] (or any later improvements to that class feature).

**Benefit**: Whenever your current hit point total is below 5 × your barbarian level, your berserker strength automatically activates. You gain a +4 bonus to your Strength score, a +2 bonus on saves, damage reduction 2/-, and a -2 penalty to your AC. The damage reduction granted by berserker strength stacks with any similar kind of damage reduction.

There is no limit to the number of times per day your berserker strength can activate. While berserker strength is active, you have the same limitation on actions as a barbarian in [[#rage]]. You cannot voluntarily end your berserker strength, although you automatically drop out of it while unconscious, helpless, or (most likely) when you receive healing to bring your current hit points above the threshold.

At 11th level (or if you would gain the [[#greater rage]] class feature from any class), your berserker strength improves instead. The bonus to your Strength score improves to +6, your bonus on saves improves to +3, and you gain damage reduction 3/- (or your existing damage reduction of the same kind improves by 3).

At 20th level (or if you would gain the [[#mighty rage]] class feature from any class), your berserker strength instead improves again. The bonus to your Strength score improves to +8, your bonus on saves improves to +4, and you gain damage reduction 4/- (or your existing damage reduction of the same kind improves by 4).

Any effect that would normally apply only during your rage applies whenever your berserker strength is active.

#### City Brawler

The urban slums you grew up in were as dangerous as any barbarian wilderness.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you choose this ability, you do not gain proficiency with martial weapons, medium armor, or shields.

**Benefit**: You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, as well as the effects of Two-Weapon Fighting feat when fighting unarmed.

At 6th level, you gain the effects of Improved Two-Weapon Fighting when fighting unarmed and at 11th level you gain the effects of Greater Two-Weapon Fighting when fighting unarmed.

You only take a -2 penalty when using improvised weapons (instead of the usual -4 penalty).

#### Dashing Step

You have mastered the technique of rushing into combat.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the [[#trap sense]] ability.

**Benefit**: You do not take a -2 penalty to Armor Class when charging. Furthermore, you add one-third of your barbarian level to your AC against attacks of opportunity when charging.

#### Devil's Luck

You make up for your lack of heartiness with astounding luck.

**Level**: 7th.

**Replaces**: If you choose this ability, you do not gain [[damage reduction]].

**Benefit**: You apply the number of points of damage reduction you would otherwise gain as a luck bonus on all saving throws.



#### Duskling Barbarian

The duskling's savage nature lends itself well to life as a barbarian. She channels incarnum to enhance her speed and defense, relying on her race's natural link to this mystical energy rather than pure physical prowess. Though not quite as tough as a typical barbarian, she makes up for this with her ferocious determination and powers of incarnum.

**Hit Die**: d10.

##### Requirements

To take a duskling barbarian substitution level, a character must be a duskling about to take her 1st, 7th, or 11th level of barbarian.

##### Class Skills

Duskling barbarian substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard barbarian class, plus [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the duskling barbarian racial substitution levels.

**Incarnum Speed (Su)**: A duskling barbarian can channel incarnum to dramatically improve her land speed and her ability to react to danger. Every point of essentia invested in this class feature increases the character's base land speed by 10 feet, but only while wearing medium, light, or no armor and not carrying a heavy load. This is an enhancement bonus, and thus does not stack with a duskling's racial ability to increase her speed. A duskling barbarian also gains an insight bonus on initiative checks equal to twice the invested essentia.

This benefit replaces a standard barbarian's [[#fast movement]] class feature gained at 1st level.

**Incarnum Defense (Su)**: At 7th level, a duskling barbarian gains the ability to use incarnum to protect herself against damage. Investing a point of essentia in this class feature grants damage reduction 1/- and 1 point of resistance to all types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic); every additional point of essentia invested increases this damage reduction and resistance to energy by 1.

This benefit replaces a standard barbarian's [[damage reduction]] class feature gained at 7th level. A duskling barbarian who selects this substitution level never gains damage reduction from her barbarian class levels.

**Incarnum Rage (Su)**: Beginning at 11th level, when a duskling barbarian enters a rage, she gains 2 points of essentia. This essentia disappears when the rage ends.

This benefit replaces a standard barbarian's [[#greater rage]] class feature gained at 11th level. If a duskling barbarian would later gain the [[#mighty rage]] class feature, she instead gains greater rage.

  

**Table: Duskling Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Illiteracy, incarnum speed, rage 1/day|
|7th|+7/+2|+5|+2|+2|Incarnum defense|
|11th|+11/+6/+1|+7|+3|+3|Incarnum rage|

  

#### Fangshields Barbarian

Barbarians of the Fangshields have few worries about traps, because they spend most of their time in their home territory rather than crawling through dungeons. They train their bodies to their physical peak so they can be the shock troops of the organization, relying on their speed and strength to decimate enemy creatures quickly. Other monsters can fight in formation against massed enemies, but the Fangshields barbarians are skilled at charging opposing monsters and battering them with a few powerful hits.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a Fangshields barbarian substitution level, a character must be a nonhumanoid creature, be a member of the Fangshields, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 3rd, 5th, or 7th level of barbarian.

##### Class Skills

Fangshields barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Fangshields Barbarian Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3rd|+3|+3|+1|+1|Fast charge (+10 ft.)|
|5th|+5|+4|+1|+1|Awesome charge|
|7th|+7/+2|+5|+2|+2|Raging vigor|

  

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Fangshields barbarian substitution levels.

**Fast Charge (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a Fangshields barbarian gains a 10-foot enhancement bonus to his speed when he charges. This applies to any type of movement the barbarian uses.

This benefit replaces the [[#trap sense]] class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 3rd level. At any level where a standard barbarian gains a bonus to trap sense (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th), a Fangshields barbarian instead increases the enhancement bonus to his charge speed by 10 feet.

**Awesome Charge (Ex)**: At 5th level, a charging Fangshields barbarian in a rage can make an attack at the end of the charge as if he had the [[Awesome Blow]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. (Normally, Awesome Blow requires a standard action; this is a specific exception to that rule.)

This benefit replaces the [[#improved uncanny dodge]] class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 5th level.

**Raging Vigor (Ex)**: At 7th level, a Fangshields barbarian gains the ability to direct his force of will inward, causing his injured body to heal itself. As a standard action, he can spend one of his daily uses of rage to heal damage equal to twice his Hit Dice. He can even use this ability if he is already raging.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's [[damage reduction]] gained at 7th level. Instead, the Fangshields barbarian gains damage reduction 1/- at 10th level, and his damage reduction is treated as 1 point lower than normal from that point forward.

#### Fearsome Gaze

Your merest glance can break a man's will to fight.

**Level**: 6th.

**Replaces**: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the [[#indomitable will]] ability and your [[#trap sense]] ability is reduced by 1.

**Benefit**: You gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks and can use Strength instead of Charisma as your key ability for Intimidate. You and your target must be within 60 feet and must be able to see one another.

#### Ferocity

Where most barbarians define themselves by nigh-unstoppable rage, a few streetfighters and urban warriors have mastered different techniques. By working up a surge of adrenaline, they hit just as hard, and substantially faster, than their counterparts, while dodging the inevitable counterattack.

**Class**: Barbarian.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain [[#rage]], or any later improvements to that class feature, nor do you gain [[#indomitable will]].

**Benefit**: Once per day, the barbarian can enter a state of adrenaline-fueled fury, increasing both his physical might and his reaction time. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +4 bonus to Dexterity, but he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls beyond short range (30 feet).

He can enter this state as an immediate action, even when flat-footed at the start of combat, so he may apply the enhanced Dexterity modifier to his initiative check.

While in a state of ferocity, the barbarian cannot use any Charisma- or Intelligence-based skills (except for Intimidate), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except item creation feats and metamagic feats. Ferocity lasts for a number of rounds equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier (if positive). The barbarian may prematurely end his state of ferocity. At the end of ferocity, he loses the ferocity modifiers and restrictions and become [[sickened]] (-2 on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies). Abilities that normally render him immune to being sickened (such as the Strong Stomach feat) reduce the penalties to -1, but do not remove them entirely.

The barbarian can invoke ferocity only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level).

_Greater Ferocity_: At 11th level, his bonuses to Strength and Dexterity during ferocity each increase to +6. In addition, the duration of his ferocity increases to 5 + your Constitution modifier (if positive).

_Shifting Stance_: At 14th level, while in a state of ferocity, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class and Reflex saves.

In addition, while in a state of ferocity, the barbarian can stand from prone as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If a foe that threatens him has a base attack bonus that is 4 points or more higher than his barbarian level, however, she gains an attack of opportunity as normal. (These abilities replace indomitable will.)

_Relentless Ferocity_: At 17th level, the duration of his ferocity increases to 6 + his Constitution modifier (if positive), and he no longer become sickened at the end of his ferocity. In addition, the dodge bonus granted by his shifting stance ability becomes +2.

_Unstoppable Ferocity_: At 20th level, the barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Dexterity during ferocity each increase to +8.

#### Frostfell Barbarian

Of all the classes, the barbarian is the most at home in the frostfell. The mere fact that civilization has yet to fully colonize vast reaches of the frostfell means that land is plentiful for barbarians to live their nomadic lifestyle. Humans, neanderthals, half-orcs, and orcs comprise the majority of barbarians dwelling in most polar frostfell regions, but this isn't necessarily the norm. Frostfell barbarians often use dire wolves, megaloceroses, tlalusks, and even woolly mammoths as mounts.

**Trap Sense**: Barbarians may add their [[#trap sense]] bonus on Reflex saves made against natural hazards of the frostfell, as well as to their Armor Class against attacks made by natural hazards. Hazards of the frostfell include dangers such as avalanches, snow-filled crevasses, and other terrain features of frostfell terrain.

This ability replaces the benefits a standard barbarian receives from having trap sense.

#### Golarion Barbarian

Barbarians in the cold climates of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Worldwound sometimes have the ability below, which replaces the [[#trap sense]] ability.

**Cold Resistance (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains cold resistance 2. This resistance increases by 2 for every 3 additional levels the barbarian attains, for a total of cold resistance 12 at 18th level.

#### Goliath Barbarian

The wild, tribal lifestyle of the goliath lends itself naturally to life as a barbarian. Some goliath barbarians tap into the race's natural connection to the power of the mountains to gain increased strength and durability, but at the cost of some of the barbarian's traditional agility.

The goliath barbarian can choose three racial substitution levels: one at 1st level, one at 5th level, and the last at 7th level.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a goliath barbarian substitution level, a character must be a goliath about to take his 1st, 5th, or 7th level of barbarian.

##### Class Skills

Goliath barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class plus [[Knowledge]] (nature) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Goliath Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Fast movement, illiteracy, mountain rage 1/day|
|5th|+5|+4|+1|+1|Fortification|
|7th|+7/+2|+5|+2|+2|Skin of stone|

  

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the goliath barbarian's racial substitution levels.

**Mountain Rage (Ex)**: A goliath barbarian who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can tap into the mountain's strength to increase his size and power during a rage. When he rages, his size category increases to Large. (Although his size category increases by one step, the goliath barbarian's height only increases by a foot or so and his mass only increases by about 30-40%, so his equipment still fits normally.) This change increases the barbarian's space and reach to 10 feet and applies a -1 penalty on attack rolls and to AC. However, he does not gain additional benefits on weapon size and grapple checks, since he already has them from his powerful build ability.

The goliath barbarian also gains an additional +2 bonus to his Strength when he enters his mountain rage.

Mountain rage replaces the standard barbarian's [[#rage]] ability, and when a barbarian would normally gain extra uses of the rage ability per day, he instead gains extra uses of the mountain rage ability. However, the barbarian gains these benefits in addition to the normal benefits and penalties of his rage (+4 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 on Will saves, and -2 to AC). The barbarian is also still fatigued for the duration of the encounter when his rage ends. If the goliath barbarian's rage bonuses improve from other effects (such as greater rage), the extra Strength bonus from mountain rage stacks.

**Fortification (Ex)**: A goliath barbarian who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level develops a tough hide that allows him extra protection against potentially devastating attacks. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a goliath barbarian with this substitution benefit, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's [[#improved uncanny dodge]] ability.

**Skin of Stone (Ex)**: A goliath barbarian who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from most attacks. He gains damage reduction 2/adamantine. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction increases by 2 points.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's 7th-level [[damage reduction]] ability, as well as the damage reduction gained at higher levels.

#### Half-Orc Barbarian

Most half-orcs are raised in harsh lands, far from civilization. They tap into their inner anger and power to become devastating berserkers who charge into combat with relish. Those who grew up among orcs are particularly fond of huge, cleaving weapons that can reap terrible destruction. This substitution allows a half-orc barbarian to sacrifice some of his intuitive defenses to become more aggressive in combat.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a half-orc barbarian substitution level, a character must be a half-orc about to take his 2nd, 5th, or 7th level of barbarian.

##### Class Skills

Half-orc barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Half-Orc Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+2|+3|+0|+0|Reckless charge|
|5th|+5|+4|+1|+1|Insightful rage|
|7th|+7/+2|+5|+2|+2|Two-handed strike|

  

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the half-orc barbarian racial substitution levels.

**Reckless Charge (Su)**: At 2nd level, the half-orc barbarian gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls when making a charge, but takes a -4 penalty to AC. These values replace the normal bonus and penalty accorded to a charging character.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's [[#uncanny dodge]] ability. If the barbarian would later gain improved uncanny dodge as a barbarian class feature, he gains uncanny dodge instead.

**Insightful Rage (Ex)**: While raging, a half-orc barbarian of 5th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to disbelieve illusion spells.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's [[#improved uncanny dodge]] ability.

**Two-Handed Strike (Ex)**: The half-orc barbarian focuses his combat talents toward massive, two-handed melee weapons. At 7th level, the half-orc barbarian gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with any two-handed melee weapon.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's [[damage reduction]] 1/- gained at 7th level. From this point forward, the half-orc barbarian's damage reduction is treated as one point less than the noted value (1/- at 10th level, 2/- at 13th level, and so forth).

#### Halfling Barbarian

Tribal halflings, those who take halfling barbarian substitution levels, are just as dangerous as any other barbarian, but for different reasons. These small warriors can take advantage of their size and slip into areas inaccessible to larger races. When it comes time to stand tall in battle, however, these barbarians prove as tough in combat as any of the bigger races.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a halfling barbarian substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of barbarian.

##### Class Skills

Halfling barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Intelligence modifier.

  

**Table: Halfling Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Fast movement, halfling rage 1/day, illiteracy|
|3rd|+3|+3|+1|+1|Intimidating presence +1|
|5th|+5|+4|+1|+1|Bigger than life|

  

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the halfling barbarian's racial substitution levels.

**Halfling Rage (Ex)**: Halfling barbarians learn to minimize the impact of their size while in combat. Whenever a halfling barbarian rages, treat him as a Medium creature whenever doing so would be beneficial, such as while in a grapple. While raging, the halfling's size actually increases slightly, and he therefore loses his +1 size bonus to AC and on attacks. Otherwise, this ability is exactly like the standard rage ability.

Whenever the halfling barbarian gains additional uses of the rage ability, he instead gains additional uses of this ability. Feats that alter the rage ability, such as [[Extend Rage]] or [[Instantaneous Rage]], instead alter the halfling rage ability.

This class feature replaces the standard barbarian's rage ability.

**Intimidating Presence (Ex)**: A halfling barbarian who takes the 3rd-level racial substitution level gains ritualistic scarring and tribal tattoos that make him a frightening sight to behold. Beginning at this level, the halfling barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you are also using the scarification rules presented in the "Ritual Markings" article in DRAGON #340, markings from this ability count as traditional scarring.

This class feature replaces the standard barbarian's trap sense ability. Whenever the halfling barbarian would otherwise gain an additional +1 to his trap sense ability, he instead gains an additional +1 bonus on Intimidate checks. If the halfling barbarian gains the trap sense ability from another class (such as rogue), that ability functions normally.

**Bigger Than Life (Ex)**: A halfling barbarian who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level makes Intimidate checks as if he were size Medium. If the halfling barbarian is under an effect that actually makes his size Medium (such as an enlarge person spell), this ability has no further impact, but he retains his bonus on Intimidate checks from the intimidating presence ability.

This class feature replaces the standard barbarian's improved uncanny dodge ability.

#### Horselord

Few classes are as viscerally satisfying to play as the barbarian. Barbarian rage - that carnival of crushing and screaming, grunting and cleaving that can so quickly reduce a pack of opponents into piles of so much tainted meat - provides a thrill hard to resist. Clearly, the standard barbarian taps into the spirit of Conan and the tales of Viking berserkers: the powerfully built wild man who can enter a frenzied orgy of violence at will.

Historically, not every warrior belonging to a group considered barbaric relied on his physical prowess. Some of history's most notorious barbarians - Attila the Hun, Arpd the Magyar King, and Genghis Khan, for instance - hardly reflected Schwarzenegger-esque proportions (Attila was reputed to be quite a small man, in fact). How, then, were they able to loot and pillage just as effectively as their burly Viking colleagues? The answer lies in a contemporary description of the warriors of the Mongol horde: "They were small men on the ground, but they were giants in the saddle."

The horselord is a variant barbarian. Unless otherwise noted, a horselord advances in the same manner as a barbarian (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of barbarian or horselord, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level barbarian twice.

The horselord loses [[#fast movement]] and [[#trap sense]], but gains several new abilities. The horselord does not [[#rage]], replacing that ability with a battle ecstasy he can use with the same frequency.

**Battle Ecstasy**: Traditional cultures from the Celts to the Sioux speak of warriors able - through special prayers, protective garments, or even nakedness in battle - to become invulnerable to the weapons of the enemy. A horselord who enters battle ecstasy becomes difficult to harm. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and damage reduction 1/-. The horselord's damage reduction while in battle ecstasy stacks with the damage reduction he receives at higher levels (thus, a 7th-level horselord has DR 2/- while in battle ecstasy). A horselord can use any skill or feat while in battle ecstasy, but all skill checks except for Handle Animal and Ride take a -2 penalty. Battle ecstasy lasts as long as a barbarian's rage and has the same fatiguing effect. Beginning at 17th level, the horselord is no longer fatigued after leaving a battle ecstasy. The horselord's battle ecstasy has no greater rage or mighty rage equivalents.

**Skills**: A horselord takes no penalty on Ride checks for riding bareback and gains a +2 bonus when using any kind of saddle (which stacks with the normal +2 bonus on Ride checks when using a military saddle). A horselord must choose a kind of animal he knows of and has ridden as a mount at least once. He receives a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks whenever dealing with the selected kind of animal (most horselords choose the animals their tribes routinely use).

**Animal Companion**: At 4th level, the horselord's mount becomes an animal companion as per the ranger abilitiy of the same level. The horselord must own and ride the horse for at least two months before he can bond with it in this way. Treat the mount in all ways as the animal companion of a ranger of the same level as the horselord, except the horselord's mount retains the animal type and is not considered a magical beast. If the mount is killed or otherwise lost, the horselord can find a new companion mount after 1d4 months of searching and a successful DC 15 Handle Animal check.

**Improved Mounted Archery**: At 6th level, the horselord gains [[Improved Mounted Archery]] as a bonus feat.

#### Hunter

A barbarian who prefers crafty hunting over pure ferocity might choose to exchange his rage ability for certain [[ranger]] class features.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: [[#rage]], [[#greater rage]], [[#indomitable will]], [[#tireless rage]], [[#mighty rage]].

**Gain**: [[Favored enemy]] (as [[ranger]]), [[archery combat style]], [[improved archery combat style]], and [[archery combat style mastery]] (as [[ranger]]).

#### Implacable

The toughest dwarven warriors generally become dwarven defenders, but a few find the orderliness of most dwarven cultures a poor fit for their chaotic nature. Over the centuries these rowdy dwarves developed a combat style all their own. They call themselves implacables, and enemies of the dwarves fear their wrath. The implacable fighting style resembles that of many barbarians, but possesses enough subtle differences to make it uniquely dwarven. An implacable, like any barbarian, expends his energy in a short burst of rage, but rather than channel this wrathful energy into an overwhelming assault he channels it into defense.

Implacables study defense first to protect others and only secondarily to protect themselves. An implacable stays alive and in the enemy's path, letting his allies accomplish their mission. If forced to fight alone he throws all his energy into selling his life dearly. Before he falls, he kills as many of the enemy as possible. Tougher even than a conventional barbarian and as determined as a dwarven defender, a single implacable can hold out against a large number of opponents. A large contingent of these indomitable warriors in the throes of their rage strikes fear into even small armies of foes.

Although dwarves begot the implacables, other races soon discovered their value. Gnomes and humans, trading partners with dwarves and more likely to embrace chaos, soon generated implacables of their own. These nondwarven implacables usually serve as dedicated protectors of their communities, although more than a few have exploited that protective power to make themselves into warlords. Eventually, a few savage humanoids learned to emulate their opponents. Implacables receive less acclaim in orc society than conventional barbarians, but goblins and bugbears embrace the implacable style. These implacables give the savage races the perfect defense against the armies of civilized races.

The implacable is a variant barbarian. Unless otherwise noted, an implacable advances in the same manner as a barbarian (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of barbarian or implacable, he may not later take levels in the other. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level barbarian twice.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: An implacable is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor and shields (except tower shields).

**Fast Movement**: An implacable does not get the fast movement class feature.

**Resilient Rage**: An implacable in a resilient rage looks less like a bloodthirsty reckless barbarian and more like an impatient but doggedly determined guardian. He doesn't gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, his rage more resembles the dwarven defender's defensive stance, granting him a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, a +2 bonus on Will saves, and damage reduction 1/-. This temporary damage reduction stacks with the permanent damage reduction the implacable gains at higher levels.

Resilient rage is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all respects. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Dexterity and Constitution bonuses increase to +6, and the temporary damage reduction bonus improves to 2/-. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Dexterity and Constitution bonuses increase to +8, and the temporary damage reduction bonus improves to 3/-.

#### Natural Born Barbarian

Culture often exerts as strong a pull upon young people as their lineage. Acquiring likes, loathings, special talents, and important insights at their parent's knee, a body of lore comes to them almost as a birthright. A few, however, follow their own unique paths. They take other ways, scorning the lessons so eagerly sought by their playmates in favor of what they teach themselves. These atypical members of the different races usually band together. Although too rare or new to be true subraces, it is groups such as these that eventually interbreed and develop into their own subsets of the common races. All of the racial traits presented here focus on characters who begin play at 1st level as barbarians, so these alternative racial traits might not work well in a world where the standard races already have "wild" subraces. Given a few generations, however, those with these new racial traits might easily interbreed to such an extent that they form wild subraces.

These new racial traits require a character to begin play as a barbarian and to give up one or more standard racial traits. As elves and half-orcs lack (or have very few) racial traits based on their cultures, they gain compensating drawbacks instead of losing traits they already have.

Because these alternative rules fundamentally alter the way races work, a DM is encouraged to have a careful and thorough understanding of these racial traits before allowing them in her campaign.

##### Dwarf Barbarian

Let the frail and infirm spend their time fiddling with rocks or shuddering at the tread of orcs and goblins. You sneered at the terrors others felt, never willing to admit to the visions of unnatural creatures haunting your dreams. Now, in moments when your fury bursts forth you rend and tear at what once made you cower under your covers.

These dwarf barbarians lose stonecunning, their bonus on Appraise and Craft checks, and their +1 bonus on attack rolls versus orcs and goblins. In exchange, they gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made against aberrations and undead when raging.

##### Elf Barbarian

Sometimes, even as you outwardly shout and froth at the mouth, you find yourself in the eye of the storm, calm and relaxed while you loose arrow after arrow. Unfortunately, this strange detachment carries a danger too, one that leaves you idly watching as your foes draw nearer.

These elf barbarians gain the use of the Rapid Shot feat while raging even if they Lack the prerequisites. In exchange, they take a -2 penalty on initiative checks.

##### Gnome Barbarian

You saw no need to talk with useless beasts or to make a spectacle of yourself entertaining fools. As your innate magic developed you displayed abilities to help you overwhelm your enemies.

These gnome barbarians lose their ability to cast speak with animals as well as the other spell-like abilities normally available to their kind. In exchange, they gain the ability to cast cure minor wounds, guidance, jump, and resistance (self only) once each per day. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's Charisma modifier + spell level.

##### Half-Elf Barbarian

They treated you like a freak, an outsider who wasn't strangled at birth simply out of charity. You fled into the wilderness and while learning to live off the land developed a need for revenge that makes others quail before your anger.

These half-elf barbarians lose their +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks and in exchange gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate and Survival checks.

##### Half-Orc Barbarian

Let the weak squint over paper. You know the world belongs to the mighty - not the learned. Rather than considering it a drawback you embrace your willful ignorance and turn it to your advantage.

These half-orc barbarians can never learn to read, even if they take levels in other classes, nor may they ever place skill ranks in any [[Knowledge]] skill. A half-orc barbarian's contempt for "book learning" grants him a +2 bonus on all Intimidate and Survival checks.

##### Halfling Barbarian

While others dangled from trees and romped through the forest you learned to stay perfectly still as your playmates drew near.

These halfling barbarians lose their bonus to Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks, becoming in exchange extremely adept at camouflage and the art of the ambush. A halfling barbarian gains a bonus on Hide checks made in natural surroundings equal to half her barbarian level (minimum +1).

#### Planar Barbarian

Barbarians who strike beyond their homeland sometimes find that they go far indeed. Barbarians have no trouble with the dangers, the miles, and the wonders that traveling entails, and planar travel, while more grand, offers a barbarian a chance to refine his abilities with extraplanar enemies in mind.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a barbarian planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 3rd, 7th, or 11th level of barbarian.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Barbarian planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class plus [[Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Barbarian Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3rd|+3|+3|+1|+1|Portal sense|
|7th|+7/+2|+5|+2|+2|Planar damage reduction|
|11th|+11/+6/+1|+7|+3|+3|Menacing rage|

  

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the barbarian's planar substitution levels.

**Portal Sense (Su)**: The barbarian's raw instincts provide him with a supernatural sense concerning portals, planar breaches, and other passages between planes. A barbarian who takes the 3rd-level planar substitution level instantly becomes aware of any portal within 30 feet of his location, even if such a portal is normally invisible. In a sense, the barbarian seems to "sniff" out the portal. If the barbarian spends a few rounds "sniffing" around (taking a standard action each round to do so), he learns additional information about the portal (the rounds spent analyzing the portal need not be consecutive):

_Round 1_: Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.

_Round 2_: Any special circumstances governing the portal's use, such as knowing that it can be activated only at specific times of the day (but not what those times are) or if a special key or command word is needed to activate the portal (but not what that key or command word is).

_Round 3_: A brief sense of the area the portal leads to; essentially, the barbarian gains as much information as if he were allowed to see the portal's destination for 10 seconds, without the benefit of any other sense or analysis.

This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 3rd level. From now on, whenever the barbarian gains a standard barbarian level that grants an improvement to his trap sense, he gains the indicated bonus minus 1 (trap sense +1 at 6th level, trap sense +2 at 9th level, and so on).

**Planar Damage Reduction (Ex)**: The barbarian toughens his body against injuries perpetrated by unnatural creatures. A barbarian who takes the 7th-level planar substitution level gains the ability to shrug off some additional amount of injury from each blow or attack made by an outsider or extraplanar creature. Subtract 2 points from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack made by an outsider or extraplanar creature. In effect, this benefit grants damage reduction 2/- against the attacks of outsiders or extraplanar creatures.

This benefit replaces the damage reduction 1/- gained by a standard barbarian at 7th level. From now on, whenever the barbarian gains a standard barbarian level that grants an improvement to his damage reduction, he gains the indicated amount minus 1 (1/- at 10th level, 2/- at 13th level, and so on). However, the planar damage reduction value stacks with the barbarian's damage reduction against attacks from outsiders or extraplanar creatures. For example, a 10th-level barbarian would have damage reduction 3/- against outsiders and extraplanar creatures, but damage reduction 1/- against all other creatures.

**Menacing Rage (Su)**: The barbarian gains an especially potent fury against unnatural creatures not native to the Material Plane. A barbarian who takes the 11thlevel planar substitution level generates an intangible aura of danger whenever he rages. This aura weakens hostile outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype within 20 feet. Any outsider or extraplanar creature within that area must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 barbarian's class level + barbarian's Con modifier). Those who fail the saving throw take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saves against the barbarian for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability. A creature that makes its initial save is not affected by that same barbarian's menacing rage for 24 hours.

This benefit replaces the greater rage class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 11th level. If the barbarian later qualifies for the mighty rage class feature, he gains greater rage instead.

#### Relentless Smash

Your powerful attacks can put an opponent in an undesirable state.

**Level**: 20th.

**Replaces**: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the mighty rage ability.

**Benefit**: If you make a successful critical hit against an opponent or strike him at least three times in the same round your opponent is stunned for 1d3 rounds.

Furthermore, if your opponent is your size or smaller he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + total damage you dealt to him this round) or be knocked prone.

#### Roof-Dweller

Those who grow up on the streets of the city are often equally at home above the streets, where the rooftops provide an unseen highway.

**Class**: Barbarian.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain fast movement.

**Benefit**: The barbarian gains [[Roofwalker]] as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.

Additionally, as of 6th level, he need not meet the prerequisites for the [[Roof-Jumper]] feat if he chooses to take it, though it is not a bonus feat; the barbarian must still spend a feat slot to acquire it.

#### Skilled City-Dweller

The various wilderness-oriented skills are valuable indeed, but make less sense - and may prove less useful - for an urban character.

**Class**: Any class that has one or more of the "skills replaced," as listed below, on its list of class skills.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the "skills replaced" as listed below.

**Benefit**: The skilled city-dweller gains one or more skills as class skills, at the expense of other skills. If she does not have the proper skill to lose, she cannot gain the skill it grants as an urban benefit.

Note that she need not swap out all these skills. A skilled city-dweller may pick and choose, but she cannot later change her mind.

|Skill Replaced|Skill Gained|
|---|---|
|[[Handle Animal]]|[[Gather Information]]|
|[[Knowledge]] (nature)|[[Knowledge]] (local)|
|[[Survival]]|[[Sense Motive]]|
|[[Ride]]|[[Tumble]]|

  

#### Spell Sense

Most barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger, whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap. Some, however, fine-tune this ability to focus on magical attacks, granting them the ability to dodge the orbs, rays, and eldritch blasts of their enemies.

**Class**: Barbarian or rogue.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Special Requirement**: [[Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain the trap sense class feature (or any later improvements to that class feature).

**Benefit**: Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every three barbarian or rogue levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and so on to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This is an extraordinary ability.

#### Spiritual Totem

Choose a spiritual totem: bear, eagle, fox, lion, or wolf. Once you do so, you are forever bound to that animal spirit. Your connection grants you special abilities based on the totem you have chosen (or that has chosen you, as some see it).

The DM can add more totems to the above list as desired, using those presented here as guidelines.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the fast movement class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain one of the abilities described below, depending on the chosen totem. Each of these effects is a supernatural ability.

_Bear Totem_: The mighty bear is known for her crushing embrace, if you adopt her as your spiritual totem, you gain the [[improved grab]] ability.

_Eagle Totem_: The eagle can see clearly over great distances and often notices details that are not obvious. If you embrace him as your spiritual totem, you gain a +4 bonus on Search and Spot checks.

_Fox Totem_: The cunning fox uses stealth to gain the upper hand. Should you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain a +4 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

_Lion Totem_: Regal and intimidating, the powerful lion is a symbol of nobility among the races of the wild. By selecting him as your spiritual totem, you gain the [[pounce]] ability.

_Wolf Totem_: The wolf is a loyal ally who uses pack tactics to subdue her foes. If you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain an additional +2 bonus on attack rolls when flanking an opponent.

#### Streetfighter

The ability to take a blow is valuable, but on the violent and crowded streets of the city, the winner of a brawl or a duel is often the one who can hit hardest and fastest.

**Class**: Barbarian.

**Level**: 7th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain damage reduction at 7th level, or any of the improvements to damage reduction at higher levels.

**Benefit**: The barbarian gains the ability to swiftly bring the fight to his foe and to hit him hard.

At 7th level, the critical threat range of any charge attack he makes, or any attack he makes against a flat-footed foe, increases by 1. (Thus, a greataxe would threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.) This ability stacks with the Improved Critical feat or the keen weapon enhancement.

At 10th level, the barbarian can make a single turn, up to 90 degrees, during a charge.

At 13th level, the barbarian can charge through squares occupied by his allies or by noncombatants.

At 16th level, the barbarian can move up to four times his speed when making a charge attack, rather than double.

At 19th level, the barbarian acquires a "cleaving charge." If he drops an opponent on a charge attack, and he has at least 10 feet of movement remaining, he can immediately make a new charge attack against a second foe. If he drops that foe and still has movement remaining, he can charge a third, and so on until he either fails to drop a foe, or runs out of movement. All the other standard rules for a charge attack still apply, including the fact that he must have at least 10 feet of distance to make the charge.

Even if he somehow gains the ability to make multiple attacks on a charge (such as with the lion's charge spell from the Spell Compendium), he must drop the foe on the first attack to use this ability. Similarly, he cannot use this ability and Cleave or Great Cleave in the same round.



#### Totem Barbarian

In a barbarian-heavy campaign, you can increase the variation between barbarian characters if each barbarian tribe dedicates itself to a different totem creature, such as the [[#bear-totem|bear]] or the [[#jaguar-totem|jaguar]]. The choice of a totem must be taken at 1st level, and cannot be changed later except under extreme circumstances (such as the barbarian being adopted by another tribe).

If you use this variant, the barbarian loses one or more of the following standard class features: fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge. In place of these abilities, the barbarian gains class features as determined by his totem. All totems do not necessarily grant abilities at the same levels, nor do they all grant the same number of abilities. These class features are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise indicated.

The list of totems discussed here is by no means exhaustive. If you prefer to use other totems, you can either substitute the totem name for that of a similar creature (such as changing the [[#lion-totem|Lion]] Totem to the [[#tiger-totem|Tiger]] Totem or create a new set of totem abilities, using the information here as a guide.

##### APE TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A barbarian dedicated to the ape totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

- At 1st level, an ape-totem barbarian gains a climb speed equal to one-half his base land speed (round down to the nearest 5-foot interval). For instance, a human, elf, half-elf, or half-orc ape-totem barbarian has a climb speed of 15 feet, while a dwarf, gnome, or halfling ape-totem barbarian has a climb speed of 10 feet.
- At 2nd level, an ape-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on [[Intimidate]] checks.
- A 3rd level ape-totem barbarian gains [[Power Attack]] as a bonus feat.
- At 5th level, an ape-totem barbarian's climb speed equals his base land speed.

##### BEAR TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A barbarian dedicated to the bear totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

- A 1st-level bear-totem barbarian gains [[Toughness]] as a bonus feat.
- At 2nd level, a bear-totem barbarian gains [[Improved Grapple]] as a bonus feat, even if he doesn't meet the normal prerequisites.
- A 3rd-level bear-totem barbarian gains [[Great Fortitude]] as a bonus feat.
- Beginning at 5th level, a bear-totem barbarian gains a +4 bonus on [[grapple]] checks when raging.

##### BOAR TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A barbarian dedicated to the boar totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

- When raging, a 1st-level boar-totem barbarian is treated as having the [[Diehard]] feat, even if he doesn't meet the normal prerequisites.
- At 3rd level and higher, a boar-totem barbarian's rage lasts for 2 rounds longer than normal.
- Beginning at 7th level, a boar-totem barbarian's [[damage reduction]] is 1 point higher than the normal value. Thus, at 7th level, a boar-totem barbarian's damage reduction is 2/-, and it rises by 1 point every three levels thereafter.

##### DRAGON TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A barbarian dedicated to the dragon totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

- A 1st-level dragon-totem barbarian gains [[Blind-Fight]] as a bonus feat.
- At 2nd level, a dragon-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on saves against [[paralysis]] and sleep effects.
- At 5th level, a dragon-totem barbarian gains the [[frightful presence]] ability. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 barbarian level + barbarian's Cha modifier.

##### EAGLE TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A barbarian dedicated to the eagle totem does not gain the standard fast movement and trap sense barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

- At 1st level, an eagle-totem barbarian's keen vision grants him a +2 bonus on [[Spot]] checks.
- An eagle-totem barbarian gains [[Lightning Reflexes]] as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

##### HORSE TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A barbarian dedicated to the jaguar totem represents the "standard" barbarian and gains the standard barbarian class features.

##### LION TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

- At 1st level, a lion-totem barbarian gains [[Run]] as a bonus feat.
- A 2nd-level lion-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on [[Hide]] checks.
- A 5th-level lion-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls whenever he [[charges]].

- A 2nd-level wolf-totem barbarian gains [[Improved Trip]] as a bonus feat, even if he doesn't meet the normal prerequisites.
- A 5th-level wolf-totem barbarian gains [[Track]] as a bonus feat.

#### Totem Manifestation

As the bond between you and your totem grows closer, the spirit of your chosen animal reveals itself more strongly.

**Level**: 7th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the damage reduction class feature, including all damage reduction increases gained at higher levels of the barbarian class.

**Benefit**: When you select this ability, your connection to your spiritual totem intensifies. If you have not yet chosen a spiritual totem, you must do so now, but you gain only those abilities described here, not those for the spiritual totem alternative class feature. Each of these effects is a supernatural ability.

_Bear Totem_: The powerful bear rewards your loyalty. If you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain 1 extra hit point per barbarian level.

_Eagle Totem_: The keen-eyed eagle grants you low-light vision if you adopt him as your spiritual totem. If you have previously chosen the eagle as your spiritual totem, the bonus on [[Search]] and [[Spot]] checks increases by 1 at each level at which your damage reduction would increase (10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels).

_Fox Totem_: The quick fox grants you a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class if you choose her as your spiritual totem. This bonus increases by 1 at each level at which your damage reduction would increase (10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels). Any condition that causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also negates this dodge bonus.

_Lion Totem_: If you select the lion as your spiritual totem, he rewards you with the ability to loose a powerful and intimidating roar. As a standard action, you can roar, requiring every creature within a 30-foot radius to succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your barbarian level + your Str modifier) or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to your barbarian level. This ability can be used once per day, and you gain an additional use per day at each level at which your damage reduction would increase (10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels).

_Wolf Totem_: The wolf is an intelligent hunter who can track her prey with uncanny accuracy and insight. If you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain Track as a bonus feat. In addition, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on [[Survival]] checks.

#### Trapkiller

You have a knack for avoiding and disabling traps. Your keen instincts help you avoid danger, while your great strength enables you to disrupt dangerous devices.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the trap sense ability.

**Benefit**: Beginning at 3rd level, you gain [[trapfinding]], except that you can use Survival instead of Search to locate traps. However, you take a -5 penalty on such checks because of your comparative unfamiliarity with the mechanisms and triggers involved.

Once you find a mechanical trap, you can attempt to disarm it by making an attack roll. You succeed if the result exceeds the Disable Device DC of that trap. Only traps with moving mechanisms or gears (such as shifting floor panels, dropping portcullis gates, or arrow traps) can be disarmed in this manner; simple pitfalls and most magic traps have no mechanism to be so disrupted. You must be able to reach the trap with a melee attack to make a disarm attempt. If you fail to disarm the trap, you automatically spring it.

#### Uncanny Bravery

Many barbarian tribes revere dragons, while others see them as akin to natural disasters. Regardless, some barbarians learn to steel themselves against the bloodcurdling fear that these great beasts can create in weak-minded targets.

This ability also benefits rogues who try to plunder dragon hoards. Although they hope to complete the task without awakening the dragon, only the truly stupid fail to plan for such a possibility.

**Class**: Barbarian or rogue.

**Level**: 5th (barbarian) or 8th (rogue).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain improved uncanny dodge.

**Benefit**: You are immune to the frightful presence of dragons. You gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against all other forms of fear.

#### Unholy Fury

When a barbarian taps into his buried anger, he unleashes his wrath and turns into a brutal killing machine. Although many barbarians learn to control this violence, some exult in it, reveling in the slaughter they create.

**Class**: Barbarian.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: To select this alternative class feature, you must be chaotic evil. If your alignment changes to anything else, this ability reverts to the standard rage ability until your alignment is restored to chaotic evil.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the barbarian's standard fast movement ability.

**Benefit**: Once during a rage, you can unleash your unholy fury to smite a nonchaotic evil creature. You add your Charisma bonus to your attack roll and deal an extra 1 point of damage per barbarian level. If you accidentally use this ability against a creature that is chaotic evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the duration of your rage.

#### Unshakable

You fear nothing.

**Level**: 5th.

**Replaces**: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the improved uncanny dodge ability.

**Benefit**: You are immune to fear effects.

#### View the Spirit World

Your link to the divine gives you an uncanny insight into the intricacies of the spirit world. This unique perception lets you expand your senses into realms that few mortals can perceive.

**Level**: 5th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the improved uncanny dodge class feature.

**Benefit**: Once per day as a swift action, you can peer into the spirit world for a number of rounds equal to one-half your barbarian level (rounded down). While doing so, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet, can see invisible creatures, and gain a +2 bonus on Search and Spot checks. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Wasteland Barbarian

Barbarians are common in the waste, where survival often comes down to having a few basic skills and the ability to outrun or outfight predators. In very few waste locales is any kind of law enforced - aside from tribal codes and customs - so barbarians are perfectly at home. This variant barbarian gains all the class features of the standard barbarian, except as noted below.

**Wastelands Trap Sense (Su)**: At 3rd level, a waste barbarian adds the bonus from his trap sense class feature to Reflex saves made against natural hazards of the wastes, as well as to his Armor Class against attacks made by natural hazards. Hazards of the wastes include dangers such as lava pools, slipsand, softsand, and other terrain features.

This ability replaces the benefits a standard barbarian receives from having trap sense.

**Bonus Feat**: A 5th-level waste barbarian gains a bonus feat, which must be drawn from the following list: [[Blazing Berserker]], [[Endurance]], [[Great Fortitude]], Heat Endurance, [[Improved Heat Endurance]], [[Judged by Aurifar]], [[Sandskimmer]], [[Scorpion's Resolve]], and [[Self-Sufficient]]. A wasteland barbarian must meet all the prerequisites for a bonus feat in order to select it.

This ability replaces the standard barbarian's improved uncanny dodge ability.

**Wastelands Damage Reduction (Su)**: A waste barbarian toughens his body against injuries dealt by the rigors of the wastes. At 8th level, a wasteland barbarian gains damage reduction 1/- against wasteland creatures and hazards. This benefit stacks with the barbarian's normal damage reduction.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian's third daily use of the rage ability gained at 8th level. From this point forward, the waste barbarian can rage one less time per day.




#### Whirling Frenzy

A [[Barbarian]] with this variant form of rage doesn't gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the barbarian might make before his next action.

Whirling frenzy is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +4.

A barbarian using this variant doesn't gain indomitable will at 14th level. Instead, he gains evasion, but only while in a whirling frenzy.

A character can't use whirling frenzy at the same time that he uses any other form of rage (or similar ability).
