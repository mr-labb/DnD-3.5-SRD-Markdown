### MAGEWRIGHT



Magic suffuses Eberron and permeates every level of society. A truly talented blacksmith weaves spells over his forge to help her shape the steel, and a fine tapestry has a glamer on every thread to enhance its appearance. The villages and cities of Khorvaire are full of commoners, experts, and warriors, of course, just like cities elsewhere. The true experts in their craft, however, and the most successful at what they do, are the magewrights - minor spellcasters who weave arcane magic into the practice of their trade.

Magewrights are most frequently found in cities and large towns, where they are about as common as adepts. The vast majority of magewrights are members of the guilds run by the dragonmarked houses, particularly House Cannith's Tinkers Guild and Fabricators Guild. Unlike adepts, magewrights are unknown among more savage species.

A magewright's limited spell selection makes this class generally unsuitable for a player character.

**Hit Die**: d4.

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the magewright NPC class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Magewrights are proficient with all simple weapons. Magewrights are not proficient with any type of armor or with shields. Armor of any type interferes with a magewright's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A magewright casts arcane spells. He is limited to a certain number of spells of each spell level per day, according to his class level. Like a wizard, he prepares his spells ahead of time each day. Unlike wizards, magewrights do not keep spellbooks (see Spell Mastery, below) and cannot learn spells they find in spellbooks or on scrolls.

The DC for a saving throw against a magewright's spell is 10 + spell level + the magewright's Int modifier. When a magewright gets 0 spells of a given level (see the class table), he gains only the bonus spells for that spell level that he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score.

**Spell Mastery**: A magewright prepares spells as a wizard does, but does not need a spellbook to do so. Rather, a magewright's training emphasizes a small number of spells to such a great extent that he learns to prepare them without referring to a spellbook. A magewright begins play familiar with a number of spells (of any level he can cast) equal to his Intelligence modifier, exactly as though he had taken the Spell Mastery feat. Every time he gains access to a new spell level, and again at 20th level, he learns a number of new spells equal to his current Intelligence modifier, plus one 0-level spell.

For example, a 1st-level magewright with an Intelligence of 15 knows two spells, and might choose [[mending]] and magecraft. When he reaches 4th level, he increases his Intelligence to 16 and learns three more spells: [[detect magic]], [[unseen servant]], and [[make whole]]. At 8th level, he increases his Intelligence to 17 (which does not improve his Intelligence modifi er) and learns three more spells: [[arcane lock]], [[explosive runes]], and [[glyph of warding]].
