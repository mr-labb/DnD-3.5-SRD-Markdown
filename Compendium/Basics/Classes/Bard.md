### BARD



It is said that music has a special magic, and the bard proves that saying true. Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience - such is the life of a bard. When chance or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, messengers, scouts, and spies.

A bard's magic comes from the heart. If his heart is good, a bard brings hope and courage to the downtrodden and uses his tricks, music, and magic to thwart the schemes of evildoers. If the nobles of the land are corrupt, the good bard is an enemy of the state, cunningly evading capture and raising the spirits of the oppressed. But music can spring from an evil heart as well. Evil bards forego blatant violence in favor of manipulation, holding sway over the hearts and minds of others and taking what enraptured audiences "willingly" give.

Bards see adventures as opportunities to learn. They practice their many skills and abilities, and they especially relish the opportunity to enter a long-forgotten tomb, to discover ancient works of magic, to decipher old tomes, to travel to strange places, to encounter exotic creatures, and to learn new songs and stories. Bards love to accompany heroes (and villains), joining their entourage to witness their deeds firsthand - a bard who can tell a marvelous story from personal experience earns renown among his fellows. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes doing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.

A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use.

In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound.

Bards have some of the skills that rogues have, although bards they are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast [[Knowledge]] of local events and noteworthy items.

Bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than by tradition or law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible with a lawful alignment.

Bards revere Fharlanghn (god of roads). They sometimes camp near his wayside shrines, hoping to earn some coin from the travelers who stop to leave offerings for the god. Many bards, even those who are not elves, worship Corellon Larethian, god of elves and patron of poetry and music. Many good bards are partial to Pelor (god of the sun), believing that he watches over them in their travels. Bards given to chaos and occasional larceny favor Olidammara (god of thieves). Those who have turned to evil ways are known to worship Erythnul (the god of slaughter), though few will admit to it. In any event, bards spend so much time on the road that, while they may be devoted to a deity, they are rarely devoted to any particular temple.

An apprentice bard learns his skills from a single experienced bard, whom he follows and serves until he is ready to strike out on his own. Many bards were once young runaways or orphans, befriended by wandering bards who became their mentors. Since bards occasionally congregate in informal "colleges," the apprentice bard may meet many of the more prominent bards in the area. Still, the bard has no strong allegiance to bards as a whole. In fact, some bards are highly competitive with other bards, jealous of their reputations and defensive

Bards are commonly human, gnome, elf, or half-elf. Humans take well to the wandering life and adapt easily to new lands and customs. Gnomes have a sense of humor and trickery that lends itself to a bardic career. Elves are talented in music and magic, so the career of the bard comes naturally to them. A bard's wandering ways suit many half-elves, who often feel like strangers even when at home.

Half-orcs, even those raised among humans, find themselves ill suited to the demands of a bard's career. There are no bardic traditions among dwarves, or halflings, though occasional individuals of these races find teachers to train them in the ways of the bard. Bards are exceedingly rare among the savage humanoids, except among centaurs. Centaur bards sometimes train the children of humans or other humanoids.

A bard works well with companions of other classes. He often serves as the spokesman of the party, using his social skills for the party's benefit. In a party without a wizard or sorcerer, the bard contributes his magic. In a party without a rogue, he uses his skills. A bard is curious about the ways of more focused or dedicated adventurers, so he often tries to pick up pointers from fighters, sorcerers, and rogues.

The bard is perhaps the ultimate generalist. In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role. He can't usually match the stealth of the ranger or the rogue, the spellcasting power of the cleric or the wizard, or the combat prowess of the barbarian or the fighter. However, he makes all the other characters better at what they do, and he can often fill in for another character when needed. For a typical group of four characters, the bard is perhaps the most useful fifth character to consider adding, and he can make a great team leader.


**Alignment**: Any nonlawful.

**Hit Die**: d6.

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the bard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

**Spells**: A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the [[bard spells list]]. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music).

To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.

The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

**Bardic [[Knowledge]]**: A bard may make a special bardic [[Knowledge]] check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in [[Knowledge]] (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)

A successful bardic [[Knowledge]] check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of [[Knowledge]] is essentially random.

|DC|Type of Knowledge|
|---|---|
|10|Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.|
|20|Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.|
|25|Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.|
|30|Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the [[Knowledge]].|

**Bardic Music**: Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.

Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.

_Countersong (Su)_: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.

_Fascinate (Sp)_: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become [[fascinated]] with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.

To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.

Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.

_Inspire Courage (Su)_: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himselfs), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.

_Inspire Competence (Su)_: A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.

The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.

_Suggestion (Sp)_: A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already [[fascinated]] (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.

Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see [[Suggestion Mass|mass suggestion]], below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.

_Inspire Greatness (Su)_: A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.

_Song of Freedom (Sp)_: A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the [[break enchantment]] spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.

_Inspire Heroics (Su)_: A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.

_[[Suggestion Mass|Mass Suggestion]] (Sp)_: This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already [[fascinated]] (see above). [[Suggestion Mass|Mass suggestion]] is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

###### Ex-Bards

A bard who becomes lawful in alignment cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.

#### Bardic Knack

Wandering bards learn more mundane skills and less esoteric [[Knowledge]] on their travels. If you select this class feature, you have done a little bit of everything; maybe you spent a few months as a wilderness guide, and you also had a cousin in an ambassador's retinue who regaled you with tales of courtly intrigue.

The bardic knack class feature makes you more capable of accomplishing simple tasks with a wide variety of skills. You don't need to dabble in noncritical skills (unless you want to be considered trained in their use), freeing up your skill points to focus on a small range of crucial skills.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain bardic [[Knowledge]].

**Benefit**: When making any skill check, you can use 1/2 your bard level (rounded up) in place of the number of ranks you have in the skill (even if that number is 0). For example, a 5th-level bard would have the equivalent of 3 ranks in Appraise, Balance, Bluff, and so on (but only for the purpose of making skill checks).

You can't take 10 on checks when you use bardic knack (to take 10 you have to use your actual ranks). If the skill doesn't allow untrained checks, you must have at least 1 actual rank to attempt the check.

#### Bardic Sage

The bardic sage focuses his efforts on learning, research, and the power of [[Knowledge]].

**Alignment**: The bardic sage must be neutral good, neutral, or neutral evil. The true pursuit of [[Knowledge]] cares little for ethical extremes. A bardic sage who becomes chaotic or lawful cannot progress in levels as a bardic sage, though he retains all his bardic sage abilities.

**Base Save Bonuses**: The bardic sage has good will saves, but has poor Fortitude and Reflex saves.

##### Class Features

The bardic sage has all the standard bard class features, except as noted below.

**Spellcasting**: A bardic sage learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with a few exceptions. In addition to the normal number of spells known, a bardic sage knows one divination spell of each spell level he is capable of casting. For example, a 1st-level bardic sage knows four 0-level bard spells plus one 0-level bard spell of the divination school (such as [[detect magic]], [[know direction]], or [[read magic]]). The bardic sage's number of spells per day does not change.

To learn or cast a spell, a bardic sage must have an intelligence score (not Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level. All other spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs, are still determined using the bardic sage's Charisma score. Add the following spells to the bardic sage's class spell list:

1st - [[detect chaos]]/[[detect evil]]/[[detect good]]/[[detect law]];

2nd - [[zone of truth]];

3rd - [[arcane sight]];

4th - [[analyze dweomer]] (lowered from 6th), [[sending]];

5th - [[contact other plane]], [[greater scrying]] (lowered from 6th);

6th - [[true seeing]], [[vision]].

**Bardic [[Knowledge]]**: A bardic sage gains a +2 bonus on all [[bardic [[Knowledge]] checks.

**Bardic Music**: A bardic sage's powers of inspiration are not as persistent as those of a traditional bard. His ability to inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics lasts only 3 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bardic sage sing, rather than the normal 5 rounds.

#### Dead Levels

The bard has ten dead levels but gains spells per day and spells known during each one of those levels (which can be considered special abilities in their own right). Still, certain prestige classes grant +1 level of arcane spellcasting at every level along with powerful abilities to boot. This means that minor abilities are permissible during each dead level.

**Rally Performance (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a bard hones his skill as a public musician and can reroll a Perform check once per day, but only when attempting to impress audiences for the purpose of earning money. A bard must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. See the [[Perform]] skill description.

**Refine Performance (Ex)**: At 4th level, a bard learns how to make his performances more appealing to the public of a prosperous city and is considered to have rolled at least a 2 on each d10 or d6 when determining how much money was earned each day from a Perform check. See the [[Perform]] skill description. At 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 16th, and 17th level, a bard is considered to have rolled 1 number higher on each d10 (for example, a least 3 at 5th level, at least 4 at 7th level, etc.). By extension, a bard is considered to have rolled at least 3 on each d6 at 7th level, at least 4 at 11th level, and at least 5 at 16th level. At 19th level, a bard earns the maximum amount of money for his performance.

#### Divine Bard

Not all bards are arcanists; some derive their special powers from a divine tradition. In many primitive cultures, the divine bard takes the place of the [[Cleric]] or the [[adept]] as the guide of the people's religious beliefs.

##### Class Features

The divine bard has all the standard bard class features, except as noted below.

**Spellcasting**: A divine bard learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with some minor exceptions. A divine bard's spells are divine spells, not arcane spells.

To learn or cast a spell, a divine bard must have a Wisdom score (not Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level. All other Spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs, are still determined using the divine bard's Charisma score.

Like druids, paladins, and rangers, divine bards need not designate a specific deity as the source of their spells. However, a divine bard can't cast spells of an alignment that doesn't match his. Thus, divine bards cannot cast lawful spells (since bards can't be lawful). Neutral divine bards can't cast any spells associated with an alignment (and are thus relatively rare).

Add the following spells to the divine bard's class spell list:

0 - [[create water]], [[cure minor wounds]];

1st - [[detect evil]]/[[detect good]]/[[detect law]], [[protection from evil|protection from evil/Good/law]];

2nd - [[consecrate]], [[desecrate]], [[gentle repose]];

3rd - [[magic circle against evil|magic circle against evil/Good/law]], [[prayer]];

4th - [[remove disease]], [[speak with dead]], [[sending]];

5th - [[divination]], [[restoration]];

6th - [[commune]], [[hallow]], [[unhallow]], [[raise dead]].

#### Drow Bard

When adventurers think of drow arcanists, they picture the horrifically deadly drow wizards or the demonically imbued warlocks. The bard would almost certainly be at the bottom of the list of arcane classes associated with the drow. What surfacedwellers fail to realize, however, is that the drow have an ancient bardic tradition - one that transforms the traveling entertainer, trickster, and storyteller of the surface into one of the most horrific taskmasters and assassins of the Underdark.

##### Deadly [[Knowledge]]

Drow bards do not travel the world, and thus do not gain the broad range of understanding other bards have. Instead, they study a means of death-dealing normally associated with other classes.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard bard's bardic [[Knowledge]] ability. In addition, you can use your bardic music one fewer time per day than other bards (minimum 1).

**Benefit**: You are trained in the use of poison. You never risk poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

#### Fey Bard

A rare bard might display a special link to nature and the mysterious world of the fey. Such characters tend to be more aloof and less inspiring than standard bards.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Bardic [[Knowledge]], inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, inspire heroics.

**Gain**: Animal companion (as [[druid]]), nature sense (as [[druid]]), resist nature's lure (as [[druid]]), wild empathy (as [[druid]]).

#### Gnome Bard

Weavers of illusion and subtle masters of the sentient mind, gnome bards focus their talents toward abilities related to their racial strengths. Their magic includes access to more illusions than other bards can master, and their bardic music is able to inspire or negate fear, as well as bolster allies' minds against outside influence.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a gnome bard substitution level, a character must be a gnome about to take his 1st, 3rd, 6th, or 11th level of bard.

##### Class Skills

Gnome bard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Gnome Bard Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+2|Bardic music, bardic [[Knowledge]], gnome cantrips, counter fear, fascinate, inspire courage +1|Same as bard|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+3|Inspire defiance|Same as bard|
|6th|+4|+2|+5|+5|Phantasmal song|Same as bard|
|11th|+8/+3|+3|+7|+7|Secrets of bardic trickery|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the gnome bard's racial substitution levels.

**Gnome Cantrips**: A gnome bard who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level adds the following 0-level spells to his bard spells known: [[dancing lights]], [[ghost sound]], and [[prestidigitation]].

This benefit replaces two of the cantrips a bard normally knows at 1st level. Thus, a 1st-level gnome bard with this substitution level knows two cantrips of his choice plus the three mentioned here.

**Counter Fear (Su)**: A gnome bard who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level and has 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that [[cause fear]]. In each round when the bard uses his counter fear ability, he makes a Perform check. Any ally within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a fear effect can use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the counter fear effect is already under the influence of a fear effect, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the bard perform, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Counter fear has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard can keep up the counter fear ability for 10 rounds.

This substitution feature replaces the base bard's countersong bardic music ability.

**Inspire Defiance (Su)**: A gnome bard who takes the 3rd-level racial substitution level and has 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help his allies (including himself) resist outside control and discern truth from illusion. To be affected, an ally must be within 30 feet and able to hear the bard perform. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard perform and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against illusions and mind-affecting spells and effects.

This benefit replaces the standard bard's inspire competence bardic music ability.

**Phantasmal Song (Su)**: A gnome bard who takes the 6th-level racial substitution level and has 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an eerie melody with phantasmal echoes in the minds of those who hear it. While the music itself is unsettling, the phantasmal component is downright terrifying, with effects that build as the bard continues to play. Enemy creatures within 30 feet of the bard who can hear the music become shaken (Will negates; DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier). Any creature affected by phantasmal song (that is, who failed the initial Will save) that remains within range and hears the song for at least 3 consecutive rounds becomes frightened instead of shaken. The effect lasts as long as the bard performs and for 1 round after he stops, or until the affected creature moves more than 30 feet from the gnome bard.

The effects of multiple phantasmal songs do not stack with one another. Thus, a creature within the area of two phantasmal songs must save against both, but can still only become shaken on the first round even if it fails both saves. However, a phantasmal song's effect can stack with other fear effects (such as from the [[cause fear]] spell). See [[Fear]] under Special Abilities for more information on fear effects. Phantasmal song is an illusion (phantasm), mind-affecting fear effect.

This benefit replaces the standard bard's suggestion bardic music ability.

**Secrets of Bardic Trickery**: A gnome bard who takes the 11th-level racial substitution level adds the following spells to his spells known: 1st - [[color spray]]; 2nd - [[touch of idiocy]]; 4th - [[phantasmal killer]].

This benefit replaces the standard bard's ability to learn a new 4th-level spell at 11th level and his ability to exchange a spell he knows for a new spell of the same level. From now on, the gnome bard's number of 4th-level spells known is one fewer than the value shown on Table: [[Bard Spells Known]].

#### Golarion Bard

Bards trained at one of the great schools of the Inner Sea tend to favor one performance type above all others, focusing their training. Such bards have the above ability, which replaces bardic [[Knowledge]].

**Specialized Training (Ex)**: At 1st level, a bard must choose a single category of the Perform skill. Whenever the bard performs bardic music using the chosen category of the Perform skill, he is treated as being 2 levels higher when determining the effect and save DC. In addition, a bard with specialized training can make use of his bardic music one additional time per day, assuming that the additional usage uses his chosen category of the Perform skill.

#### Half-Elf Bard

Blessed with a smooth grace and demeanor that many find appealing, the half-elf bard is a common sight. The half-elf bard gives up some of her performance abilities to become more well versed in social interaction and negotiation.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a half-elf bard substitution level, a character must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 6th, or 8th level of bard.

##### Class Skills

Half-elf bard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Half-Elf Bard Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+2|Bardic music, bardic [[Knowledge]], fascinate, inspire courage +1, soothing voice|Same as bard|
|6th|+4|+2|+5|+5|[[Command]]|Same as bard|
|8th|+6/+1|+2|+6|+6|Inspire courage +2, secrets of the diplomat|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the half-elf bard's racial substitution levels.

**Soothing Voice (Su)**: A 1st-level half-elf bard with 3 or more ranks in Diplomacy can spend one daily use of her bardic music to use a composed, steady voice and reason to calm the emotions in others around her. This ability works in much the same way as the half-elf bard's fascinate ability, with the following differences.

The creature to be soothed must be within 30 feet of the bard and must be able to understand the language she is speaking. To use this ability, the half-elf bard makes a Diplomacy check. Her check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. On a success, the creature is affected as if by the [[calm emotions]] spell. The effect lasts as long as the creature listens to the bard, although the creature may wander off on its own if there is nothing to keep its interest.

This benefit replaces the standard bard's ability of countersong.

**[[Command]] (Sp)**: A 6th-level half-elf bard with at least 9 ranks in Diplomacy may spend one daily use of her bardic music to issue a command (as the spell) to a creature within 30 feet. Alternatively, the command can affect all creatures that the bard has affected with her soothing voice or fascinate ability. A Will saving throw (DC 11 + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect.

This benefit replaces the standard bard's ability of suggestion.

**Secrets of the Diplomat**: At 8th level, a half-elf bard adds the following spells to her spells known: 1st - command; 2nd - [[zone of truth]]; 4th - [[sending]].

This benefit replaces the 4th-level spell learned by a standard bard at 8th level. From now on, the bard knows one fewer 4th-level bard spell than normal (not counting the spells she learned from this substitution feature).

#### Harbinger

The harbinger reverses the fundamental power of bardic music to create darkness and doubt where the standard bard brightens the world with joyful melodies and uplifting tunes. He uses a form of bardic music ability designed to destroy the morale of others and lead them to destruction. The harbinger taps into the dark side of his art, bringing out the worst fears and insecurities in those around him.

The harbinger is a variant bard. Unless otherwise noted, a harbinger advances in the same manner as a bard (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of bard or harbinger, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level bard twice.

**Alignment**: Any nonlawful and nongood.

##### Class Features

All the following are class features for the harbinger.

**Bardic Music**: The harbinger's bardic music abilities differ from those of the standard bard. Unless otherwise noted a harbinger's bardic music abilities allow a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 harbinger level + Charisma modifier).

_Instill Fear (Su)_: A harbinger with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to instill fear into his enemies, weakening them against fear and wor sening their combat abilities. The harbinger must be able to see his targets and be seen or heard by them. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the harbinger sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected enemy takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six harbinger levels thereafter, this penalty increases by 1 (-2 at 8th, -3 at 14th, and -4 at 20th). Instill fear is a mind-affecting fear effect.

_Encourage Failure (Su)_: A harbinger of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one enemy to fail at a task. The enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the harbinger. The harbinger must also be able to see the enemy. The affected target takes a -2 penalty on all rolls for 1 round. Encourage failure is a mind-affecting ability.

_Dishearten (Su)_: A harbinger of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to dishearten a single enemy within 30 feet, causing the enemy to cower even against the weakest foe. For every three harbinger levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can dishearten one additional creature. To dishearten, a harbinger must sing and the enemy must hear the harbinger sing for a full round. A creature so affected takes a -4 penalty on saving throws and AC. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the harbinger sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Dishearten is a mind-affecting ability.

_Dirge of Binding (Sp)_: A harbinger of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect that paralyzes one target. The effect lasts as long as the creature can hear the harbinger.

_Drain Prowess (Su)_: A harbinger of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to drain prowess from up to four enemies within 30 feet, weakening their skills and fighting capabilities. For every three levels a harbinger attains beyond 18th, he can target one additional enemy with a single use of this ability. To be affected the enemies must be able to hear the harbinger sing. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the harbinger sing. A creature drained of prowess gains two negative levels. These negative level remains as long as the target creature can hear the harbinger. They never result in a permanent level loss.

#### Healing Hymn

When you play your healing hymn, your allies can cast curative spells more effectively. Furthermore, everyone around you feels rejuvenated and more fully rested when your hymn becomes a [[lullaby]].

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the fascinate bardic music ability.

**Benefit**: If you have 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill, you can use your music or poetics to create an area conducive to healing.

To be affected, an ally must be able to see and hear you perform. The effect lasts as long as you continue performing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally who casts any conjuration (healing) spell gains a +1 sacred (if you're good or neutral) or profane (if you're evil) bonus on the roll for each rank you have in the Perform skill. This ability has no effect on spells cast from wands, scrolls, or other magic items. This bonus is limited by the maximum caster level bonus of a curing spell. For example, if a level 10 cleric cast cure serious while under the effect of healing hymn used by a bard with 10 ranks in perform, the cure serious spell would only cure 3d8+15 instead of 3d8+20.

In addition, if you use this ability for at least 1 minute before you and your allies retire for the night, everyone in the group heals naturally at the end of the rest as if he had completed 24 hours of best rest (thus recovering twice his character level in hit points). If the music is interrupted, the magic of the song is lost.

Either use of healing hymn counts as one daily use of your bardic music ability. This is a spell-like ability. Healing hymn lasts as long as you concentrate up to a maximum of 2 minutes.

#### Hymn of Fortification

By singing praises to the holy powers, you can cloak yourself or an ally in a protective sheath of sound. This effect protects the subject from supernatural creatures, as well as their malign powers.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the inspire competence bardic music ability.

**Benefit**: If you are a 3rd-level or higher bard with 6 or more ranks in Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing), you can grant protection from supernatural creatures. This effect fortifies you or a single chosen ally within 30 feet against mental control and attacks from evil-aligned or summoned creatures. In most respects, hymn of fortification mirrors the effects of the [[protection from evil]] spell. If you [[wish]] to protect an ally with this ability, the two of you must be able to see and hear each other. The effect lasts as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 2 minutes.

Each use of hymn of fortification counts as one daily use of your bardic music ability. This is a spell-like ability.

#### Inspire Awe

Though occasionally derided as the "weak cousin" of the sorcerer, a bard can tap into a fragment of the same draconic power that fuels sorcerer magic. A bard who learns this ability no longer inspires courage in his allies, but instead creates fear in those who oppose him.

**Class**: Bard.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain inspire courage (or any later improvements to that class feature).

**Benefit**: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire awe in his enemies, rendering them shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to hear the bard perform. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the bard perform and for 1 round thereafter. Each enemy can attempt a Will save to negate the effect; the DC is equal to the bard's Perform check result. Regardless of the success or failure of the save, no creature can be affected by inspire awe more than once in a 24-hour period. Inspire awe is a mind-affecting fear effect.

At 8th level, the range of this effect extends to 60 feet.

At 14th level, the effect lasts for 5 rounds after the enemy can no longer hear the bard perform.

At 20th level, any enemy who fails to save becomes frightened for 1 round, then shaken for the remainder of the duration.

#### Inspire Hatred

Motivated by a desire to spread havoc and sow discord, some villainous bards abandon the techniques that inspire heroes to greatness. Instead, they prey upon secret longings and buried frustrations to [[awaken]] the hate that resides in mortal hearts.

**Class**: Bard.

**Level**: 9th.

**Special Requirement**: You must have 12 ranks in a Perform skill to use this ability.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the bardic music ability to inspire greatness.

**Benefit**: You can use music, poetics, or fiery oratory to evoke hatred in a single living creature within 30 feet that has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. For every three levels you attain beyond 9th, you can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (two creatures at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th, and so on). To inspire hatred, you must sing, speak, or perform, and the target must hear you. The target is entitled to a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your bard level + your Cha modifier) to resist this mind-affecting ability. The effect lasts for as long as the target hears you and for 5 additional rounds thereafter.

An affected creature develops an unreasoning hatred of another creature that you indicate. The affected creature attacks the object of its hate as directed, to the exclusion of other opponents. If the affected creature is attacked, it can defend itself as normal, but as soon as possible, it resumes attacking the object of its hate.

Creatures compelled to attack an ally can attempt a new Will save each round to break free from this supernatural effect.

#### Inspire Turning

You use your [[Knowledge]] of religious hymns and divine song to lend greater energy to an ally's turn undead attempt.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the inspire competence bardic music ability.

**Benefit**: You can expend one daily use of your bardic music to help an ally who attempts to turn undead (or destroy undead, if a lightbringer cleric). The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear you. You must also be able to see the ally. The ally is treated as being two levels higher than his actual level for the purpose of turning undead as long as he or she continues to hear your performance. The effect lasts as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. You can't use inspire turning on yourself. This is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.

#### Lore Song

Bardic music serves many purposes, aiding your allies or manipulating your enemies. You have refined your performance of another group of bardic songs, full of lost [[Knowledge]], obscure lore, and relevant anecdotes. These lore songs inspire you to come up with new solutions to difficult problems.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the bardic [[Knowledge]] ability.

**Benefit**: Once per day, as an immediate action, you can gain a +4 insight bonus on a single attack, check, or save. You gain one additional daily use of this ability at every odd-numbered bard level (3rd, 5th, and so on).

#### Mimicking Song

You use your bardic music to create background noise consistent with your adventuring environment, shielding the sounds made by yourself and your adventuring party as you move through dangerous areas.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the countersong bardic music ability.

**Benefit**: Mimicking song is a spell-like ability that requires you to have 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill. Using mimicking song counts as one of your daily uses of bardic music. You grant a +2 bonus on the Move Silently check of all allies within 30 feet (including yourself). This bonus increases by 2 for every five bard levels you have (to a maximum bonus of +10 at 20th level). This effect lasts as long as you continue performing.

#### Music of Creation

Bards have a unique way of tapping into the magic that pervades Eberron: through music. Some bards claim that the Dragon Above sang the world into being at the dawn of time, and that their music is an echo of that powerful tune of creation.

Reflecting this connection to the forces of creation, bards have access to a number of feats that extend the powers of their bardic music. A bard can take these feats any time she would normally gain a feat, or can choose one of them as a bonus feat instead of gaining a new form of bardic music at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, or 18th level.

These bard feats are Haunting Melody, Music of Growth, Music of Making, Song of the Heart, and Soothe the Beast.

#### Planar Bard

Some hold that if one had the eyes to see, the world would be revealed as a symphony of celestial music, each theme playing out its part on the stage of reality. For some bards, this intuition is true. When they let the scales slip from their eyes, they see the underlying overture of music that connects all levels of reality. With this [[Knowledge]], they gain some ability to add refrains of their own choosing. This fine-tuning bypasses spellcasting and directly affects what others see as reality.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a bard planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 3rd, 6th, or 12th level of bard.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Bard planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Bard Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+3|Planar inspiration|Same as bard|
|6th|+4|+2|+5|+5|Portal dissonance|Same as bard|
|12th|+9/+4|+4|+8|+8|Planar discordance|Same as bard|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the bard's planar substitution levels. Each benefit takes the place of one of the standard bardic music abilities and costs one daily use of bardic music.

**Planar Inspiration (Su)**: A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can use his music or poetics to protect his allies from the alignment traits of a plane. The bard must perform for a full minute, spending a standard action to concentrate on his performance each round. At the end of the performance, he makes a Perform check (DC 15 for mild alignment traits, or DC 25 for strong alignment traits). The bard can't take 10 on this check.

Success indicates that the bard and each ally within 30 feet who heard the bard perform for the full minute don't take the normal penalty on checks made on planes whose alignments differ from their own (see [[Alignment Traits]]) for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability.

This benefit replaces the inspire competence bardic music ability gained by a standard bard at 3rd level.

**Portal Dissonance (Su)**: A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can use music or poetics to influence intraplanar and extraplanar portals, moderate or severe planar breaches, and other discrete passages between planes (complete planar breaches cannot be affected). The portal, breach, or other qualifying passage to be affected must be centered within 60 feet. The bard must know about the portal.

Each round of the performance, he attempts a DC 20 Perform check. The bard can't take 10 on this check. Success indicates that the bard can redirect the portal destination to the mouth of any other active portal or breach he has personally traveled through in the past 30 days. Redirection automatically fails if the portal chosen as the temporary endpoint is no longer active. Only creatures and objects are affected by redirection, not traits (which leak through planar breaches). Creatures that enter the portal from the bard's side of the portal, or creatures that would otherwise arrive at the bard's location through the portal, instead arrive at the endpoint of another portal chosen by the bard this round. The portal to which the bard redirects travelers continues to connect to its original destination; if a redirected creature attempts to go back through the bard-influenced portal, it doesn't return to the bard's location, but instead to that portal's natural endpoint.

The bard may keep up the dissonance for 10 consecutive rounds (this counts as one of the bard's bardic music uses per day).

This benefit replaces the suggestion bardic music ability gained by a standard bard at 6th level. If the bard later qualifies for the [[Suggestion Mass|mass suggestion]] bardic music ability, he gains the suggestion ability instead.

**Planar Discordance (Su)**: A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can attempt to create a minor planar breach (as the [[precipitate breach]] spell). The bard must perform for 1 full minute, spending a standard action each round to concentrate on the performance.

At the end of the performance, the minor breach comes into existence with an onset time of 1d4 rounds, as indicated by the precipitate breach spell description. If the bard has further uses of his bardic music ability for the day, he may attempt to exacerbate the breach further, as described in the spell description.

This benefit replaces the song of freedom bardic music ability gained by a standard bard at 12th level.

#### Repel Domination

Your study of the undead allows you to fortify your mind against their attacks.

**Level**: 6th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the suggestion bardic music ability.

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells or abilities from undead creatures. Furthermore, whenever you succeed on such a saving throw, the undead creature that produced the effect is shaken for the remainder of the encounter.



#### Savage Bard

The savage bard is a warrior at heart, though his arcane powers strike fear into the enemies of his tribe. Savage bards often multi-class as [[Barbarian]] to improve their combat prowess.

**Alignment**: A savage bard must be chaotic in alignment. A savage bard who becomes nonchaotic cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.

**Base Save Bonuses**: A savage bard has good Fortitude and Will saves, but has poor Reflex saves.

##### Class Skills

A savage bard loses [[Decipher Script]] and [[Speak Language]] as class skills. He adds [[Survival]] to his list of class skills.

##### Class Features

The savage bard has all the standard bard class features, except as noted below.

**Illiteracy**: A savage bard is illiterate, just as a [[Barbarian]] is. An illiterate savage bard cannot use or scribe scrolls.

**Spellcasting**: Remove the following spells from the savage bard's class spell list: [[calm emotions]], [[comprehend languages]], [[detect secret doors]], [[erase]], [[prestidigitation]], [[read magic]], [[#sepia snake sigil]], [[Summon Monster I|summon monster]] (I through VI).

Add the following spells to the savage bard's class spell list:

1st - [[calm animals]], [[detect snares and pits]], [[endure elements]], [[summon natures ally I|summon nature's ally I]];

2nd - [[bulls strength|bull's strength]], [[pass without trace]], [[summon natures ally II|summon nature's ally II]];

3rd - [[snare]], [[summon natures ally III|summon nature's ally III]];

4th - [[insect plague]], [[summon natures ally IV|summon nature's ally IV]];

5th - [[commune with nature]], [[summon natures ally V|summon nature's ally V]];

6th - [[creeping doom]], [[reincarnate]], [[summon natures ally VI|summon nature's ally VI]].

#### Spellbreaker Song

Bards pride themselves on being masters of language and sound. A rare few learn to use their voices to interfere with enemy spellcasters, twisting word and sound to defeat spells before they are cast.

**Class**: Bard.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: [[Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank, Perform (any) 3 ranks.

**Replaces**: You do not gain the countersong bardic music ability.

**Benefit**: You can use your music or poetics to interfere with spells that have verbal components. Doing this costs one daily use of your bardic music ability and requires a standard action to start. Enemy spellcasters within 30 feet of you take a 20% spell failure chance when casting any spell that has a verbal component (as if they were deafened). You can maintain your spellbreaker song for 3 rounds.

This ability follows all the other appropriate rules for bardic music.

#### Spellscale Bard

Despite their inclination for sorcery, spellscales make excellent bards, exploiting their racial affinity for arcane magic and superior charm. However, [[Knowledge]] of arcane mysteries remains an important part of a spellscale bard's abilities.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a spellscale bard substitution level, a character must be a spellscale about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 6th level of bard.

##### Class Skills

Spellscale bard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Spellscale Bard Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+2|+2|Bardic music, draconic bardic [[Knowledge]], countersong, fascinate, inspire courage +1|Same as bard|
|3rd|+2|+1|+3|+3|Inspire arcana|Same as bard|
|6th|+4|+2|+5|+5|Superior suggestion|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the spellscale bard racial substitution levels.

**Draconic Bardic [[Knowledge]] (Ex)**: A spellscale bard has special interest in events, items, and individuals important to dragons. Upon taking the 1st-level racial substitution level, a spellscale bard's keen interest in dragon lore grants him a +5 competence bonus on any bardic [[Knowledge]] check related to dragons, so long as he maintains a number of ranks in [[Knowledge]] (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level.

**Inspire Arcana (Su)**: Beginning at 3rd level, a spellscale bard can spend one daily use of bardic music to make a single allied arcane spellcaster more powerful. To use this ability, a spellscale bard must have 3 or more ranks in Perform and a number of ranks in [[Knowledge]] (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level. The ally must be within 30 feet of and able to see and hear the spellscale bard, and the bard must be able to see the ally. As long as the chosen arcane spellcaster continues to hear the bard's performance, she casts her arcane spells with a +1 bonus to her caster level. The effect lasts as long as the spellscale bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire arcana upon himself. Inspire arcana is a mindaffecting ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard bard's inspire competence class feature.

**Superior Suggestion (Sp)**: A spellscale bard who takes the 6th-level racial substitution level draws on his [[Knowledge]] of his sorcerous ancestors to enhance his suggestion ability. So long as he maintains a number of ranks in [[Knowledge]] (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level, a spellscale bard gains a +2 bonus on the save DC whenever he uses his suggestion bardic music ability.

This substitution feature augments the standard bard's suggestion class feature, and it replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard bard at 6th level. From 6th level on, a spellscale bard who takes this substitution level can cast one less 2nd-level spell per day than shown on Table: The Bard.

#### Undead Bardic [[Knowledge]]

A lightbringer bard has special interest in events, items, and persons that are important to undead. Your focused, careful studies allow you to identify such creatures and effects commonly associated with them.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain bardic [[Knowledge]].

**Benefit**: You can tap into some of your specialized [[Knowledge]] of the undead. You make a check just as though using the standard bardic [[Knowledge]] ability, but your insights concern only the undead. You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. You can attempt this check in addition to a [[Knowledge]] (religion) check to learn about an undead creature or some other bit of undead lore, such as an item used to destroy a legendary undead or a plague caused by undead.
