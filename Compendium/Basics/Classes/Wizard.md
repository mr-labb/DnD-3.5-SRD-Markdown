### WIZARD

<br><br>A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend poring over her spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn the arts of magic. Wizards depend on intensive study to create their magic. They examine musty old tomes, debate magical theory with their peers, and practice minor magics whenever they can. For a wizard, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art.<br><br>Wizards conduct their adventures with caution and forethought. When prepared, they can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. They seek [[Knowledge]], power, and the resources to conduct their studies. They may also have any of the noble or ignoble motivations that other adventurers have.<br><br>The wizard's strength is her spells. Everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition to learning new spells, a wizard can, over time, learn to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. Specialization makes a wizard more powerful in her chosen field, but it denies her access to some of the spells that lie outside that field (see [[#School Specialization]]. Like a sorcerer, a wizard can call a familiar - a small, magical animal companion that serves her. For some wizards, their familiars are their only true friends.<br><br>Overall, wizards show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters, however, are masters of deception and change, respectively. They favor chaos over law.<br><br>Wizards commonly revere Boccob (god of magic). Some, especially necromancers or simply more misanthropic wizards, prefer Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic). Evil necromancers are known to worship Nerull (god of death). Wizards in general are more devoted to their studies than to their spiritual sides.<br><br>Wizards recognize each other as comrades or rivals. Even wizards from very different cultures or magical traditions have much in common because they all conform to the same laws of magic. Unlike fighters or rogues, wizards see themselves as members of a distinct, if diverse, group. In civilized lands where wizards study in academies, schools, or guilds, wizards also identify themselves and others according to membership in these formal organizations. But while a guild magician may look down her nose at a rustic wizard who learned his arts from a doddering hermit, she nevertheless can't deny the rustic's identity as a wizard.<br><br>Humans take to magic for any of various reasons: curiosity, ambition, lust for power, or just personal inclination. Human wizards tend to be practical innovators, creating new spells or using old spells creatively. Elves are enthralled by magic, and many of them become wizards for love of the art. Elf wizards see themselves as artists, and they hold magic in high regard as a wondrous mystery, as opposed to the more pragmatic human wizards, who see magic more as a set of tools or tricks. Illusion magic comes so simply to gnomes that becoming an illusionist is just natural to brighter and more talented ones. Gnome wizards who don't specialize in the school of illusion are rare, but they don't suffer under any special stigma. Half-elf wizards feel both the elf's attraction to magic and the human's drive to conquer and understand. Some of the most powerful wizards are half-elves. Dwarf and halfling wizards are rare because their societies don't encourage the study of magic. Half-orc wizards are rare because few half-orcs have the brains necessary for wizardry. Drow (evil, subterranean elves) often take up wizardry, but wizards are quite rare among the savage humanoids.<br><br>Wizards prefer to work with members of other classes. They love to cast their spells from behind strong fighters, to "magic up" rogues and send them out to scout, and to rely on the divine healing of clerics. They may find members of certain classes (such as sorcerers, rogues, and bards) to be not quite serious enough, but they're not judgmental.<br><br>The wizard's role depends somewhat on her spell selection, but most wizards share certain similarities in function. They are among the most offensively minded of the spellcasting classes, with a broad range of options available for neutralizing enemies. Some wizards provide great support to their comrades by way of their spells, while others may focus on divination or other facets of wizardry.|

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the [[Wizard Spell List|sorcerer/wizard spell list]]. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages**: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

**Familiar**: A wizard can obtain a [[familiar]]. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.

The wizard chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the wizard advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the wizard, the wizard must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per wizard level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a wizard's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

**Scribe Scroll**: At 1st level, a wizard gains [[Scribe Scroll]] as a bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats**: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of [item creation feats], [metamagic feats], or [[Spell Mastery]] when choosing these feats.

**Spellbooks**: A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.

##### SCHOOL SPECIALIZATION

A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.

A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.

The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools. A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement. Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.

The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation. Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.

_Abjuration_: Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.

_Conjuration_: Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.

_Divination_: Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.

_Enchantment_: Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.

_Evocation_: Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.

_Illusion_: Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.

_Necromancy_: Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.

_Transmutation_: Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.

_Universal_: Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.

##### FAMILIARS

A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.

|Familiar|Special|
|---|---|
|Bat|Master gains a +3 bonus on [[Listen]] checks|
|Cat|Master gains a +3 bonus on [[Move Silently]] checks|
|Hawk|Master gains a +3 bonus on [[Spot]] checks in bright light|
|Lizard|Master gains a +3 bonus on [[Climb]] checks|
|Owl|Master gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadows|
|Rat|Master gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves|
|Raven1|Master gains a +3 bonus on [[Appraise]] checks|
|Snake2|Master gains a +3 bonus on [[Bluff]] checks|
|Toad|Master gains +3 hit points|
|Weasel|Master gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves|
|1 _A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability._|   |
|2 _Tiny viper._|   |

**Familiar Basics**: Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following changes:

_Hit Dice_: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.

_Hit Points_: The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

_Attacks_: Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons. Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.

_Saving Throws_: For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

_Skills_: For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.

**Familiar Ability Descriptions**: All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.

_Natural Armor Adj._: The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.

_Int_: The familiar's Intelligence score.

_Alertness (Ex)_: While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the [[Alertness]] feat.

_Improved Evasion (Ex)_: When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.

_Share Spells_: At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).

_Empathic Link (Su)_: The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.

Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

_Deliver Touch Spells (Su)_: If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

_Speak with Master (Ex)_: If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

_Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex)_: If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.

_Spell Resistance (Ex)_: If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.

_Scry on Familiar (Sp)_: If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.

|Master  <br>Class Level|Natural  <br>Armor Adj.|Int|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st-2nd|+1|6|Alertness, improved evasion, share spells, empathic link|
|3rd-4th|+2|7|Deliver touch spells|
|5th-6th|+3|8|Speak with master|
|7th-8th|+4|9|Speak with animals of its kind|
|9th-10th|+5|10|—|
|11th-12th|+6|11|Spell resistance|
|13th-14th|+7|12|Scry on familiar|
|15th-16th|+8|13|—|
|17th-18th|+9|14|—|
|19th-20th|+10|15|—|

##### ARCANE SPELLS AND ARMOR

Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively. If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats - light, medium, and heavy - and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.

Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.

By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.

If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is [[grappling]] (although [[Concentration]] checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat [[Still Spell]] allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.

#### Aligned Spellcaster

Your passions drive your magical abilities, imbuing your every spell with the power of your conviction. Those who oppose your ideals suffer the most from your magical energy.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Choose an alignment component you have that is not neutral. Spells you cast gain the apropriate alignment descriptor unless they already have the opposite alignment descriptor. For example, a neutral good wizard who selects this ability (and who must choose good) casts all spells that aren't evil spells as good spells.

Spells you cast that target creatures of the opposite alignment are cast at +1 caster level (+2 if they have the opposite alignment as a subtype). Area of effect and other spells that affect such creatures without targeting them do not gain this bonus. A neutral spellcaster gains no benefit from this ability.

#### Anagakok

Most primitive societies have sorcerers, shamans, or witch doctors among their ranks, but a lesser-known tradition of cunning arcanists has existed for thousands of years. Found among some of the most barbaric tribes of the world, those who learn this magical discipline do not rely on instincts, personal magnetism, or divinity to weave their magic. Instead, much like the wizards of more civilized societies, they learn their mysterious craft by rote and study their spells each day, using their superior intellects to master the peculiar power of the arcane. Those who follow this path are called anagakoks.

An anagakok (ah nah GA kawk) is an alternative specialist wizard from a primitive society. Born and raised in nature and bound by the traditions of an ancient people, an anagakok has great respect for and control over the environment in which he lives. From an early age, he learns to master the art of survival in the most extreme conditions. Many of his spells grant him a measure of control over animals and plants, and others allow him to move through nature unhindered or unseen. Although he does not necessarily worship deities associated with the wilderness and the source of his power comes from arcane forces rather than from the divine, an anagakok attracts the attention of many lesser spirits of the wild. These fickle beings bestow special boons on the anagakok that make him unnaturally lucky. The members of his tribe regard him as someone who brings good fortune to the people. Most of his tribesmen cling to the belief that a guardian spirit possesses this mysterious magic weaver.

The anagakok is especially concerned with the well-being of his tribe. He helps gather food, finds safe shelter in times of crisis, and defends tribesmates against sometimes impossible odds. Because of his connection to nature and the useful spells he can cast, the anagakok is a vital member of his society. Nevertheless, like many wizards the anagakok is often attracted to a life of adventure and exploration. When an anagakok chooses to become an adventurer, he travels the world seeking to perfect his art.

An adventuring anagakok can be of valuable assistance to any party. Because his magic is especially useful in the wild, he is a great addition to any group that lacks a druid or ranger in its ranks, as well as to any party that specializes in wilderness exploration. A versatile character, the anagakok is not lost in environments unknown to him - such as in great cities.

The anagakok is a variant wizard. Unless otherwise noted, an anagakok advances in the same manner as a wizard (same base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of wizard or anagakok, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level wizard twice.

The anagakok originally appeared as a kit in second edition's Complete Wizard's Handbook.

**Alignment**: Any. Although an anagakok is rarely lawful, he can be of any alignment.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Class Skills

In addition to those of the standard wizard, the anagakok also has Survival as a class skill.

|1 _In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 0- through 9th-level spells, an anagakok gets a bonus specialization spell for each spell level for specializing in a distinctive school of magic unique to anagakoks. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Bonus specialization spells are in addition to any bonus spells the anagakok may receive for having a high Intelligence score._|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

##### Class Features

An anagakok can prepare as many spells per day a regular specialist.

**Spellbooks**: Just like a wizard, an anagakok must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for read magic, which all anagakoks can prepare from memory. An anagakok's spellbook is usually made from crudely cut layers of bark. Some anagakoks even carve the formulas for their spells on stone, tree roots, or other materials found in nature, but most prefer bark because it is lighter and easier to write on.

**School Specialization**: An anagakok is a specialist wizard (see School Specialization) specializing in a distinctive school of magic unique to anagakoks. Unlike typical wizard schools, the anagakok's school of magic regroups spells especially useful to survival in harsh environmental conditions as well as spells affecting nature in general. As such, the anagakok school of magic allows him to cast spells not typically available to other wizards (i.e., not on the wizard spell list). As a type of specialist wizard, an anagakok can prepare one additional spell of this specialty school per spell level each day, as normal. These spells go on the anagakok's spell list, allowing him to prepare them in any spell slot. He also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells of this school. The anagakok's prohibited schools are always illusion and necromancy, and he may never learn or cast spells from them. An anagakok cannot become a specialist in any other school.

The anagakok's school includes the following spells:

_0_ - create water, know direction, purify food and drink;

_1st_ - calm animals, charm animal, detect animals or plants, detect snares and pits, longstrider, pass without trace;

_2nd_ - animal trance, hold animal, reduce animal, wood shape;

_3rd_ - diminish plants, dominate animal, neutralize poison, quench, snare;

_4th_ - antiplant shell, command plants, repel vermin, rusting grasp;

_5th_ - awaken, commune with nature, control winds, tree stride;

_6th_ - find the path, repel wood, stone tell, transport via plants;

_7th_ - animate plants, transmute metal to wood, windwalk;

_8th_ - animal shapes, control plants, repel metal or stone;

_9th_ - elemental swarm, regenerate, shambler.

**Illiteracy**: With the exception of arcane spell formulas, the anagakok cannot read or write. He may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.

An anagakok who gains a level in any other class except barbarian automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains an anagakok level does not lose the literacy he already had.

**Spontaneous Casting**: An anagakok can channel stored spell energy into an endure elements spell the anagakok did not prepare ahead of time. The anagakok can "lose" any prepared spell of 1st level or higher that is not his specialist bonus spell in order to cast endure elements.

**Wilderness Lore**: An anagakok is learned in the ways of nature. He gains a +2 bonus on [[Knowledge]] (nature) and on Survival checks.

**Good Fortune**: The anagakok is well regarded by the many spirits that inhabit the wilderness and begins to attract their attention early in his career. Blessed by the spirits of nature, he gains a number of good fortune points he can apply (as an immediate action) to any die roll to gain a luck bonus equal to the number of points he expends. At 1st level, he receives 2 good fortune points per day, and this number increases by 2 more points at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. The anagakok may spread out his good fortune points to add bonuses to a number of rolls, checks, or saving throws or expend them all on a single die roll. As a readied action, the anagakok may also choose to expend his good fortune points to grant a luck bonus on the roll of an ally he can touch.

#### Arcane Reabsorption

You have always focused more on the raw manipulation of arcane energy than others of your profession. As such, you know how to possibly regain that energy when outside forces attempt to disrupt your magic.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Whenever a targeted spell you cast fails to penetrate a creature's spell resistance or is countered by another spellcaster, you can immediately attempt to reabsorb the arcane energy you just spent as an immediate action. The spell can have no effect at all in order to use this ability. By making a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + [spell level × 3]), you regain the spell as if it was never cast (or regain the spell slot if you cast spells spontaneously). Attempting this taxes your body. Regardless of the success of the check, you take 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level you attempt to reabsorb. This damage is internal and bypasses damage reduction and resistances you possess.

#### Beleaguered Spellcaster

The most fragile of all archetypes, arcane spellcasters struggle to avoid taking damage as often as possible. As injuries accumulate your desperation causes your spells to become more effective.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Whenever you take an amount of damage equal to 3 times your spellcaster level from one attack, the next spell you cast is automatically maximized or extended (your choice) without increasing the spell level or casting time.

You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + the spellcasting ability score modifier of the class in which you took this alternative class feature.



#### Changeling Wizard

The changeling wizard taps into his doppelganger heritage in order to simultaneously specialize in illusion and transmutation. He has an intuitive feel for how to change himself and others (both physically and visually), but gives up some of the standard wizard's versatility in exchange for these additional talents in deception.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a changeling wizard substitution level, a character must be a changeling about to take his 1st, 5th, or 10th level of wizard.

##### Class Skills

Changeling wizard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class, plus Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifi er (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the changeling wizard's racial substitution levels.

**Dual Specialization (Ex)**: At 1st level, a changeling wizard can choose to pursue a dual specialization in illusion and transmutation. To do so, he must give up three other schools of magic (but just as for a normal specialist wizard, a changeling wizard can't give up divination to fulfill this requirement).

A changeling wizard can prepare one additional spell per spell level each day, chosen from either of his specialty schools. For instance, he might choose to prepare ghost sound (illusion) as his additional 0-level spell and expeditious retreat (transmutation) as his additional 1st-level spell.

In addition, he gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells from either of these schools. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's specialization option.

**Limited Spell [[Knowledge]]**: A changeling wizard's focused studies in illusion and transmutation lead to an excess of [[Knowledge]] in those areas, but limit his ability to easily add spells of other schools to his spellbook. Each time the character selects a changeling wizard substitution level (other than 1st level), he chooses three spells from the illusion or transmutation schools to add to his spellbook in lieu of the normal two spells added to the standard wizard's spellbook upon gaining a new wizard level. This has no effect on a changeling wizard's ability to add other spells to his spellbook, such as those taken from a scroll or from another wizard's spellbook.

**Morphic Familiar (Su)**: At 5th level, a changeling wizard's familiar gains the ability to alter its form on command. As a full-round action, the familiar can change its form to that of any creature that the wizard could normally have as a [[familiar]]. The wizard gains the new benefit of the familiar while losing the previous benefit. If the changeling wizard does not have a familiar, this ability has no effect until he gains one.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's bonus feat gained at 5th level.

**Override Transmutation (Ex)**: A changeling wizard's skill with transmutation spells serves as a good defense against them. Starting at 10th level, if he fails his normal saving throw against a transmutation spell or spell-like ability with a duration other than instantaneous, a changeling wizard can attempt an additional save 1 round later against the same DC.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's bonus feat gained at 10th level.

  

**Table: Changeling Wizard Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+0|+2|Dual specialization, summon familiar, Scribe Scroll|Same as wizard|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Limited spell [[Knowledge]], morphic familiar|Same as wizard|
|10th|+5|+3|+3|+7|Limited spell [[Knowledge]], override transmutation|Same as wizard|

  

#### Combat Wizard

Some wizards trade their [[Knowledge]] of magic and craft to improve their combat prowess.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Scribe Scroll, wizard bonus feat list.

**Gain**: Bonus feat list (as [[Fighter]]; bonus feats gained at 1st level and every five levels as wizard).

#### Dead Levels

The wizard has fifteen dead levels, but she shares a lot in common with the sorcerer in that new spells are gained at every level (which can be considered special abilities in their own right). The primary difference between the two classes is that while sorcerers lose nothing by taking a prestige class granting +1 level of arcane spellcasting at every level, wizards miss out on up to four metamagic or item creation feats. As such, wizards are granted the least significant dead level ability.

**Animated Script (Su)**: Starting at 2nd level, a wizard can magically animate the writing in their spellbook, causing the inked symbols and words to migrate across the page. Doing so increases the Spellcraft DC for another wizard attempting to decipher or prepare spells from their spellbook by the inscribing wizard's Intelligence modifier + 1 at the cost of 5 gp per inscribed page. See Spells Copied from Another's Spellbook or Scroll. For each level in which the character does not gain a bonus feat after 2nd level, the wizard can increase the Spellcraft DC by +1 at the cost of an additional 5 gp per inscribed page (for example, +2 for 10 gp per page at 3rd level, +3 for 15 gp per page at 4th level, +4 for 20 gp per page at 6th level, and so on). The inscribing wizard can will their animated writing to stop, at which point the Spellcraft DC to copy a spell from another's spellbook returns to normal (DC 15 + spell level).

#### Deathwalker

From the earliest days of her training, the deathwalker works to gain immortality as an undead creature. The first stages of her transformation are simple changes that leave her mostly alive. As her necromantic prowess increases, however, the dark energies she commands slowly kill off her corporeal form, rotting it from the inside out. By the time she reaches 20th level, she has completed her transformation into an undead creature.

The deathwalker invests more time and effort in achieving immortality this way than she would by using other means, but the gradual change allows her to gain control of potent necromantic magic as she undergoes the necessary physical changes. Furthermore, as she grows in power, her capacity to command and control other undead creatures increases. The deathwalker may follow a more arduous road to eternal life than other necromancers, but the end result is immortality plus power - a potent combination indeed.

Deathwalkers crave undeath, and they view necromancy as a useful tool for collecting and commanding utterly obedient undead servants. Many deathwalkers are utterly amoral, seeing living beings in the same light as they do skeletons or zombies. Both categories of beings, living and mindless undead, are little more than tools or objects to be used and manipulated for their own twisted ends. Some deathwalkers are content to remain in their isolated towers and strongholds, but most are too ambitious to rest on their laurels. Their casual disdain for the living leads them to pursue rituals that require the deaths of hundreds of innocents with little concern for the potential repercussions of their actions.

**Alignment**: Any evil.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Class Skills

The deathwalker's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Bluff]] (Cha), [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Knowledge]] (all skills, taken individually) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the deathwalker.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Like most arcane spellcasters, a deathwalker receives only minimal training with weapons and none with armor. She is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a deathwalker's movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A deathwalker casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list in the Player's Handbook. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time, like a wizard. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a deathwalker must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a deathwalker's spell is 10 + the spell level the deathwalker's Intelligence modifier.

Like a wizard, a deathwalker can cast only a certain number of arcane spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on the table for her class. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

All deathwalkers function as necromancer specialist wizards for the purpose of spellcasting. They must specialize in necromancy and choose prohibited schools as per the standard rules for specialist wizards.

**Spellbooks**: A deathwalker must record her spells in thick books. Each morning, she pores over these tomes to prepare her spells for use later in the day. The deathwalker can prepare read magic from memory, but all other spells must appear in her spellbooks before she can prepare them. A deathwalker gains all 0-level wizard spells (except for those from prohibited schools) at 1st level. In addition, she gains three 1st-level spells and an additional number equal to her Intelligence bonus. Thereafter, each time the deathwalker achieves a new level, she gains two new spells of any level or levels that her new level allows her to cast.

Like a wizard, a deathwalker may select the Spell Mastery feat.

**Master of the Dead (Sp)**: At 1st level, the deathwalker gains the ability to bind certain undead creatures to her service, controlling them as though with animate dead. If the deathwalker or any of her allies attack a controlled creature, control is immediately broken for that creature.

Upon confronting a zombie or skeleton, the deathwalker can attempt a Charisma check (DC 15 + the undead's Hit Dice) to command it. She cannot use this method if she or any of her comrades have already attacked the target creature.

A deathwalker can control only 5 HD worth of skeletons and zombies per deathwalker level. (Treat undead with less than one Hit Die as 1-HD undead for the purpose of this ability.) If she attempts to gain control of undead in excess of her limit, she must immediately release already controlled zombies and skeletons from her service until the number she has under her control falls to or below her limit. The limit of 5 x the deathwalker's class levels is the maximum number of Hit Dice of mindless undead that the deathwalker can control by any means, including animate dead, (That is, casting animate dead does not allow the deathwalker to exceed this limit.)

The deathwalker's ability to control undead using master of the dead extends only to skeletons and zombies.

At this point in her development, the deathwalker gains a pale complexion and an unnaturally low body temperature. Her hands are cold to the touch, and her eyes have a glassy look. She takes a -2 penalty on all Fortitude saves to resist negative levels as her life force begins to waver within her physical shell.

**Undead Familiar**: A deathwalker's familiar is always an undead creature. The deathwalker uses all the standard rules that a wizard would for gaining a familiar, but the creature that arrives immediately becomes undead. Its type changes to undead, and all its Hit Dice become d12s (this does not affect its hit points). Like other undead, it has no Constitution score. It gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet if it did not already have it, and it also gains the standard [[undead]] traits. Treat the familiar's Hit Dice as equal to its master's for the purpose of turn, rebuke, or bolster attempts. The creature cannot be commanded by anyone save its own master.

**Aura of the Grave (Ex)**: At 5th level, the deathwalker continues her slow descent into an undead state. She no longer needs to sleep, and she gains immunity to sleep effects. She also becomes immune to all diseases. Her nerve endings begin to dull, making her less able to feel pain.

The physical effects of the deathwalker's continuing transformation become more marked at this point. Her skin draws tightly over her body, giving her a hollow, empty look. Any person viewing her may make a [[Knowledge]] (arcana) check (DC 25) to determine that she follows the deathwalker's path. Because of her decreased tactile sense, she may absentmindedly skewer her hand with a needle while deep in thought, singe her hand on a hot stove without noticing, or fail to note the flies that land on her eye or buzz in or near her mouth. Slowly but surely, she continues to lose her grip on life.

**Shroud of Death (Ex)**: As the deathwalker's magical prowess increases, her physical body continues to fail. Yet, in many ways, she becomes stronger than ever. As her body dies, her organs rot in place, but the necromantic energies she has learned to harness keep her bodily processes functioning enough to sustain the shred of life remaining in her.

At 10th level, the deathwalker gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against poison, paralysis, and mind-affecting effects. Since her organs have largely ceased functioning, there is a 50% chance that extra damage from a critical his or sneak attack does not affect her. This ability works much like the fortification special armor quality. She no longer needs to eat or drink to stay alive (although she still must breathe). However, the stench of decay that surrounds her imposes a -2 penalty on Charisma, Bluff, and Diplomacy checks against any creatures except undead.

**Mastery of Undeath (Su)**: At 15th level, the deathwalker gains the ability to force obedience and servitude From even the mightiest undead creatures. The raw force of her necromantic magic combined with the slow replacement of her living body with undead flesh make her appear as a commanding, regal figure to the undead. She gains the ability to rebuke or command undead as an evil cleric of her deathwalker level a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma bonus (if any).

She also develops further outward signs of her descent into undeath. Her stomach bloats and may even split open because of the rot within her body, and her teeth turn yellow and fall from her gums.

**Mantle of Undeath**: At 20th level, the deathwalker finally becomes an undead creature. She loses her Constitution score and any bonus hit points she had previously gained from it, and her Hit Die type becomes d12 (but the deathwalker's hit point total does not change). Her type changes to undead, and she gains the standard [[undead]] traits. She does not lose any of the racial traits she previously possessed, and her attack bonuses, save bonuses, and other statistics are not recalculated.

#### Disciple of Boccob

As a deeply loyal and pious student of Boccob the Uncaring, you know the secret to creating powerful magic items through your understanding of the Archmage of the Deities' teachings.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: You qualify for item creation feats as a character 1 level higher. Magic items you create are crafted at +1 caster level. The item gains this bonus for free; you do not pay the extra cost associated with a higher caster level. If you destroy a permanent magic item you lose all arcane spellcasting abilities for a day per caster level of the item.

#### Domain Granted Power

So great are the extent of your study and the depth of your faith that you can call upon the power of one of your deity's domains.

**Level**: 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a wizard at 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th level.

**Benefit**: Choose one cleric domain. If you worship a specific deity, the domain you choose must be one to which your deity grants access. You now can use that domain's granted power as a cleric does, but you do not gain access to its spells or extra spell slots. If the granted power is based upon cleric level, it becomes instead based upon your wizard level.

**Special**: If you take levels in a class that grants you a domain choice (such as cleric), you gain the full benefits of the domain in addition to the other domains available to you from that class.

#### Domain Wizard

A wizard who uses the arcane domain system (called a domain wizard) selects a specific arcane domain of spells, much like a cleric selects a pair of domains associated with his deity. A domain wizard cannot also be a specialist wizard; in exchange for the versatility given up by specializing in a domain instead of an entire school, the domain wizard casts her chosen spells with increased power.

Some of the arcane domains described below have the same name as a divine domain. Regardless of any apparent similarity, these domains have no connection to one another.

##### Class Features

The domain wizard has all the standard [[wizard]] class features, except as noted below.

**Arcane Domain**: At 1st level, a domain wizard selects an arcane domain from those listed below. (At the game master's discretion, the player might create an alternatively themed domain instead.) Once selected, the domain may never be changed.

A domain wizard automatically adds each new domain spell to her list of known spells as soon as she becomes able to cast it. These spells do not count against her two new spells known per wizard level.

A domain wizard casts spells from her chosen domain (regardless of whether the spell was prepared as a domain spell or a normal spell) as a caster one level higher than her normal level. This bonus applies only to the spells listed for the domain, not all spells of the school or subtype whose name matches the domain name.

In some cases, an arcane domain includes spells not normally on the wizard's class spell list. These spells are treated as being on the character's class spell list (and thus she can use wands or arcane scrolls that hold those spells, or even prepare those spells in her normal wizard spell slots).

**Spellcasting**: A domain wizard prepares and casts spells like a normal wizard. However, a domain wizard gains one bonus spell per spell level, which must be filled with the spell from that level of the domain spell list (or with a lower-level domain spell that has been altered with a [[metamagic feat]]).

**No Prohibited Schools**: Unlike a specialist wizard, a domain wizard need not select any prohibited schools or domains. All wizard spells are available to her to learn.

#### Drakken Familiar

Arcane spellcasters, even those who don't claim the blood of dragons as their own, often have a special link with dragonkind. One manifestation of this link is the caster's familiar, which can take on draconic characteristics.

**Class**: Hexblade, sorcerer, or wizard.

**Level**: 4th (hexblade) or 1st (sorcerer or wizard).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, your familiar does not gain all the benefits normally accorded to a familiar. See below to determine which alternative benefits it gains, and which standard benefits these replace.

**Benefit**: Your familiar is a drakken version of a normal animal. It gains the dragonblood subtype and all the benefits of being a familiar, except as described below.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to deliver touch spells, it gains a breath weapon instead. This breath is a 15-foot cone of fire, usable once per hour, that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + twice your class level (levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for this purpose). A successful Reflex save (10 + 1/2 your total class levels for determining the familiar's abilities) halves the damage dealt.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to speak with animals of its kind, it instead gains the ability to speak with creatures of the dragon type.

#### Drow Wizard

Wizards are among the most feared and admired nondivine members of drow society. Despite their innate resistance to magic, the drow have great respect for both the spells and the [[Knowledge]] available to these masters of the arcane arts. Although they are not directly tied to Lolth in the way divine casters and warlocks are, their devotion to the Spider Queen - and indeed, their very upbringing within society - has led to the development of race-specific wizard traits.

##### Abyssal Specialist

Most wizards who choose to specialize do so in a specific school. Many drow wizards instead focus on a variety of spells closely linked to the powers and objectives of the Weaver of Webs. The basic mechanic for specialization is the same, but the specifics differ.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you cannot specialize in a school of magic, and you lose the ability to cast spells from a prohibited school.

You must select one school of magic to serve as your prohibited school, and you can never cast spells from it or use spell completion and spell trigger devices connected to it, as per normal specialist rules. You may not select divination as your prohibited school.

**Benefit**: You are considered specialized, but not in a specific school. Rather, you gain all the benefits of specialization with a group of spells that includes all those of the following subschools and/or descriptors: chaotic, compulsion, darkness, evil, and fear. You gain all the standard benefits of specialization as applied to this group of spells, as though it were a school unto itself.

#### Dukar

These wizards of a dwindling order protect the tenuous peace under the Sea of Fallen Stars, working quietly and secretly to achieve their goals and rebuild their numbers. Many of their powers stem from living coral implanted under the skin of their hands.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a Dukar substitution level, a character must be a member of the Dukars, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 5th, 10th, or 15th level of wizard. The first time a character takes a Dukar substitution level, he must undergo a secret Dukar ritual that implants the living coral under the skin of his palms (see Dukar hand coral). The coral does not interfere with using his hands in any way. If the Dukar somehow loses this coral, he loses his coral-related powers, but if he is implanted again he immediately regains his full abilities.

##### Class Skills

Dukar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class plus Swim.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Dukar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Coral claw, bonus spells|Same as wizard|
|10th|+5|+3|+3|+7|Coral power, bonus spells|Same as wizard|
|15th|+7/+2|+5|+5|+9|Coral power, bonus spells|Same as wizard|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Dukar substitution levels.

**Bonus Spells (Ex)**: There are four Dukar orders, each with two associated schools of magic. Upon taking his first Dukar substitution level, a Dukar chooses one order and can never change it thereafter (similar to choosing a wizard specialty school). Each time a Dukar substitution level is taken, a Dukar adds two spells to his spell book; these must be from one or both of his order's associated schools of magic (either one from each or both from the same). A specialist wizard Dukar is not restricted to choosing these bonus spells from his school of specialization, but he cannot use them to acquire spells from his prohibited school (therefore, choosing an order that studies one of your prohibited schools is normally a bad choice). The orders are as follows.

|Order|Color|Schools of Magic|
|---|---|---|
|Jhimar*|Red|Enchantment, evocation|
|Kupav|Blue|Aburation, transmutation|
|Maalirn|Green|Conjuration, divination|
|Numos|White|Illusion, necromancy|

* _The order of Jhimar was destroyed centuries ago and its [[Knowledge]] and traditions are lost._

This class feature replaces the standard wizard's ability to add two spells to his spellbook each time he gains a wizard level.

**Coral Claw (Ex)**: At 5th level, a Dukar can extend the coral under his skin to form sharp spikes on his hand, giving him a claw attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. The Dukar is automatically proficient in the coral weapon and can extend or retract the coral as a swift action.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat normally gained by a 5th-level wizard.

**Coral Power**: At 10th and 15th level, a Dukar learns how to use his implanted coral in different ways. Each time this ability is gained, a Dukar chooses one ability from the following choices. Each ability can be taken twice, with increasing effect.

_Acid (Ex)_: A Dukar adds 1d4 points of acid damage to all claw attacks (including those made with his coral claw; see above). The acid quickly decays and cannot be stored for later use. A Dukar and his gear are not harmed by his own coral's acid. This ability functions automatically, though a Dukar can suspend or resume this ability as a free action. If a Dukar selects the ability a second time, the acid damage increases to 1d8 points.

_Armor (Ex)_: Three times per day as a standard action, a Dukar can make his coral extend hard growths across his skin, giving him a +1 enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus to AC. These growths crumble to dust after 10 minutes. If a Dukar selects this ability a second time, the enhancement bonus to his natural armor increases to +2.

_Color Spray (Sp)_: A Dukar's coral gains the ability to glow intensely in confusing patterns. At will as a standard action, a Dukar can use this light as a color spray effect. Using this ability requires the Dukar to have one hand free, uncovered, and able to make gestures. The save DC of this ability is Intelligence-based. If a Dukar takes this ability a second time, the save DC of this ability increases by 2.

_Wound Transfer (Su)_: A Dukar's coral develops the ability to transfer life energy by touch from him to another creature, healing its wounds at the expense of his own health. Each use of this ability heals the target of 1d6 points of damage and deals a like amount of damage to the Dukar. If a Dukar chooses this ability a second time, he heals the target of 2d6 points of damage and takes a like amount of damage per use. This ability can never provide a target more hit points than its full normal total +10. Any hit points gained beyond its normal maximum are treated as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat normally gained by a 10th- or 15th-level wizard.

#### Eidetic Spellcaster

Unlike other wizards, you can see within your mind the intricate arcane symbols, words, and gestures that define your spells. Your photographic memory acts as your spellbook, inscribing the spells you know within your mind.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar or the Scribe Scroll bonus feat.

**Benefit**: You do not need a spellbook, either to record spells you know or to prepare known spells. You can learn spells normally, either through gaining levels in wizard or learning from other spellbooks, and you must pay all the normal costs for learning new spells (used instead in special incenses rather than inks), but you do not need to put them into a spellbook.



#### Elf Wizard

Elves are naturally enthralled by the study of magic, and many of history's most famous wizards were elves. Elf wizards typically prefer a general approach to magic, recognizing the value in versatility.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take an elf wizard substitution level, a character must be an elf about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of wizard.

##### Class Skills

Elf wizard substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard wizard class, plus Search.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the elf wizard's racial substitution levels.

**Generalist Wizardry**: A 1st-level elf wizard begins play with one extra 1st-level spell in her spellbook. At each new wizard level, she gains one extra spell of any spell level that she can cast. This represents the additional elven insight and experience with arcane magic.

The elf wizard may also prepare one additional spell of her highest spell level each day. Unlike the specialist wizard ability, this spell may be of any school.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's ability to specialize in a school of magic.

**Natural Link (Su)**: At 3rd level, an elf wizard's link to her familiar strengthens. The bonus on skill checks, saves, or hit points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus on Reflex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants +6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies when the familiar is within arm's reach of the wizard; when the creature is farther away than that, the normal bonus applies (unless the familiar is more than one mile away, in which case no bonus applies).

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard familiar's ability to deliver touch spells (normally gained by the familiar of a 3rd-level wizard) and the familiar's ability to speak with animals of its kind (normally gained by the familiar of a 7th-level wizard). If the wizard's familiar already has either of these abilities (for instance, if the character is a multiclass sorcerer/wizard), it loses those abilities when the wizard selects this substitution level.

**Bonus Feat**: At 5th level, an elf wizard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Defensive Archery, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, or Weapon Focus (longbow/composite longbow or shortbow/composite shortbow only). The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's bonus feat gained at 5th level.

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

1 _Loyalty, while admirable in anyone, can greatly benefit sorcerers or wizards who keep their original familiars throughout their careers. Those who take the Improved Familiar feat and refuse to cast aside their cherished animal partner in favor of a more powerful creature might explore new abilities derived from this enhanced connection. There are several enhancements an arcane spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat might gain if he retains his original familiar rather than acquiring a new and more powerful one. Each enhancement has a requisite level in an arcane spellcasting class as well as a specific familiar._

**Blindsense (Ex)**: You gain [[blindsense]] out to 20 feet. Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, you notice things others cannot see.

**Hallucinatory Perspiration (Ex)**: Your sweat causes creatures rash enough to bite you to suffer violent hallucinations. Whenever a creature vulnerable to poison bites you it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your arcane spellcaster class levels + your Constitution modifier) or be affected by the confusion spell for 1d4 rounds.

**Nine Lives (Su)**: When you roll to stabilize, you have a 50% chance of success instead of the standard 10% chance.

**Regrow (Ex)**: You can heal your own wounds as a paladin lays on hands. Each day you can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to half your arcane spellcasting level × your Charisma modifier).

**Scent (Su)**: You gain the [[scent]] ability. You can identify familiar odors just as normal humans do familiar sights.

**Second Memory (Ex)**: You may seek your familiar's sometimes dubious advice. Whenever you attempt a [[Knowledge]] check for a [[Knowledge]] skill in which you have at least 1 rank your raven familiar attempts to assist you. It need only make a DC 10 Intelligence check to do so. If it succeeds, you receive the standard +2 bonus on your skill check.

**Self-Cannibalize (Su)**: Your will to survive allows you to feed upon your magic. Once per day you may, as a free action, sacrifice one of your available spell slots or prepared spells to convert some lethal damage you take from an attack or spell into nonlethal damage. The level of the spell sacrificed represents the number of hit points converted into nonlethal damage.

**Tracker (Su)**: You gain a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks. You also gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, you can see three times as far as a normal human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.

**Swarm Familiars**: To gain a swarm familiar, you must have the Improved Familiar feat. This permits the following modifications to the standard rules for familiars as described in the Player's Handbook. An animal or vermin swarm becomes a magical beast swarm familiar. Swarms of other types retain their type when they become swarm familiars. Swarms without an Intelligence score, such as vermin, gain an Intelligence score of 1. Swarm familiars do not gain the ability to speak with others of their kind, and neither the swarm nor its master gains the Alertness feat. Instead, the following special qualities are substituted for those standard familiar abilities.

_Granted Abilities_: In addition to special abilities gained as a result of standard familiar progression, swarm familiars also bestow the following abilities upon their masters. The swarm's master gains immunity to her familiar's nauseating effect and any of its other special attacks (filth fever, spider poison, and so on) and can occupy the same space as her familiar without suffering penalties. Swarm familiar granted abilities replace the granted abilities listed for improved familiars.

_Hive Mind (Ex)_: Swarm familiars gain a hive mind that connects them to each other by the arcane power of their master. The master gains an empathic link and the ability to share spells with the hive mind of the swarm familiar.

_Nonhealing (Ex)_: When a swarm takes damage, part of it is physically destroyed. Therefore, swarm familiars cannot be healed in the normal manner. Instead, new creatures must be summoned to the swarm to replace those that have died. A summon swarm spell "cures" a swarm familiar by replacing dead creatures in the swarm at a rate of 1d6 hit points per caster level. The number of hit points healed in this manner cannot exceed the swarm's maximum hit point total. Only a druid or the wizard to whom the swarm familiar belongs can cure a swarm familiar in this fashion. Summon swarm spells used to heal a familiar create no other effect.

#### Filidh

Highly respected lawgivers of barbarian society, filidhs draw their power from their [[Knowledge]] and application of lore. They provide judgments in legal disputes and defend their people using the mysterious ways of their ancestors. If shamans are the conscience of the tribe and skalds its memory, then filidhs are its unshakable will.

The filidh is a variant wizard. Unless otherwise noted, a filidh advances in the same manner as a wizard (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of wizard or filidh, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level wizard twice.

Filidhs seek to preserve the beliefs of their tribe. As enforcers of ancestral traditions, they seek out magical power to increase their [[Knowledge]] and strengthen their position within the tribe. These barbaric lore keepers tend toward neutral alignments, although both lawful and chaotic societies have traditions filidhs might seek to uphold. To aid them, most filidhs typically devote a significant number of spells to divination, balancing them with other offensive or supporting spells. These tribal wizards equate [[Knowledge]] with power and carefully dispense their learning to a select few. They tend to play subtle but domineering roles in any group, even if they do not obviously lead it. Many filidhs associate with religious orders or druids as they often hold similar perspectives and goals.

Devout and spiritual beyond most traditional wizards, filidhs usually worship gods of [[Knowledge]], magic, poetry, or travel. They also highly respect and might worship creator gods, as they are usually credited with teaching laws to the first mortals. Other filidhs worship nature gods and explore the secrets of both the natural and the unseen world.

##### Class Skills

The filidh's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Gather Information (Cha), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Knowledge]] (all skills, taken individually) (Int), [[Sense Motive]] (Wis), [[SpellCraft]] (Int), and [[Survival]] (Wis).

##### Class Features

The filidh loses the base wizard's Scribe Scroll, bonus feats, and summon familiar class features but gains several abilities related to [[Knowledge]] and divination. All of the following are class features of the filidh.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiencies**: Filidhs are proficient with the club, dagger, quarterstaff, and shortbow but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a filidh's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

**Filidh [[Knowledge]]**: This ability functions as the bardic [[Knowledge]] ability. A filidh with levels in another class that grants bardic [[Knowledge]] stacks those levels with her filidh levels when determining her total bonus to bardic [[Knowledge]] checks.

**Greater Divining**: A filidh is able to cast divination spells as if her caster level was +1 level higher at 5th level. This ability increases to +2 levels higher at 10th level, +3 levels higher at 15th level, and +4 levels higher at 20th level.

#### Fleshcrafter

Death is the converse of life. The same forces that can drain a creature's life force can also channel that energy and forge it into useful tools. Thus, although necromancy delves into the power of death, the fleshcrafter can use it to gain control over life, manipulating it to his own ends. His black magic creates unholy abominations - mockeries of life built from the blood and bone of his countless victims. He sees living creatures in the same light that an artist sees a canvas and paints, but his "art" consists of twisting, and forming those raw materials into whatever shapes suit his foul goals.

The fleshcrafter lurks at the edge of society, picking off the weak and those unlikely to be missed. His lab might feature still-beating hearts kept alive in a vat of demonic ichor, furniture crafted from creatures' limbs that moves and adjusts itself on command, and half-formed jigsaws of body parts that vaguely resemble humanoid forms. Many fleshcrafters seek out victims who have particular features - innocents with the perfect arms, feet, or other body parts - for their experiments. To the typical fleshcrafter, such victims are like apple trees with fruit ripe for harvest.

**Alignment**: Any evil.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Class Skills

The fleshcrafter's class skills and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Knowledge]] (all skills, taken individually) (Int), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

Bonus necromancy spells are in addition to any bonus spells the fleshcrafter may receive for having a high Intelligence score._|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the fleshcrafter. When an ability requires humanoid bodies, the fleshcrafter can substitute corpses of different size categories, according to the following equivalences.

|One Corpse of  <br>This Size Equals...|Number of  <br>Medium Corpses|
|---|---|
|Small|1/2|
|Large|4|
|Huge|16|
|Gargantuan|64|
|Colossal|256|

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Like most arcane spellcasters, a fleshcrafter receives only minimal training with weapons and none with armor. He is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a fleshcrafter's movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A fleshcrafter casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list in the Player's Handbook. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time, like a wizard. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a fleshcrafter must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a fleshcrafter's spell is 10 + the spell level the fleshcrafter's Intelligence modifier.

Like a wizard, a fleshcrafter can cast only a certain number of arcane spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the table for his class. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score.

All fleshcrafters function as necromancer specialist wizards for the purpose of spellcasting. They must specialize in necromancy and choose prohibited schools as per the standard rules for specialist wizards.

**Spellbooks**: A fleshcrafter must record his spells in thick books. Each morning, he pores over these tomes to prepare his spells for use later in the day. The fleshcrafter can prepare read magic from memory, but all other spells must appear in his spellbooks before he can prepare them. A fleshcrafter gains all 0-level wizard spells (except for those from prohibited schools) at 1st level. In addition, he gains three 1st-level spells and an additional number equal to his Intelligence bonus. Thereafter, each time the fleshcrafter achieves a new level, he gains two new spells of any level or levels that his new level allows him to cast.

Like a wizard, a fleshcrafter may select the Spell Mastery feat.

**Craft Construct**: A fleshcrafter gains [[Craft Construct]] as a bonus feat.

**Stitched Flesh Familiar**: While other spellcasters summon familiars to do their bidding, the fleshcrafter forms his own. He can build a construct familiar with a value of 300 gp by gathering the necessary body parts from three Medium humanoids that he has killed, and making successful DC 18 Craft checks. He must then donate a portion of his own life force to grant his construct the spark of life. This portion of the process costs an additional 100 gp in components. (Failing the Craft check uses up this last 100 gp as well as any other wasted materials and money.) This shared life force creates such a deep bond between the two that the fleshcrafter cannot create another such familiar until his current servant dies.

A stitched flesh familiar gains the abilities indicated on the Stitched Flesh Familiar Abilities table, based on its master's level. It also gains all the abilities described under "Familiar Basics" in the [[Familiars]] section. Many of the abilities below are standard familiar abilities, but the stitched flesh familiar gains them at a slower rate. A few are unique to the familiar.

**Table: Stitched Flesh Familiar Special Abilities**

|Master  <br>Class Level|Natural  <br>Armor Adj.|Int|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st-2nd|+1|6|Empathic link, improved evasion, uncanny likeness|
|3rd-4th|+2|7|Alertness, share spells|
|5th-6th|+3|8|Deliver touch spells, speak with master|
|7th-8th|+4|9|—|
|9th-10th|+5|10|Sustained spirit|
|11th-12th|+6|11|Spell resistance|
|13th-14th|+7|12|Scry on familiar|
|15th-16th|+8|13|—|
|17th-18th|+9|14|—|
|19th-20th|+10|15|—|

_Uncanny Likeness_: The close link that the stitched flesh familiar has with its master alters its physical appearance. Anyone who sees the familiar and has already seen its master may make a DC 20 Spot check to note the similarity between the two.

_Sustained Spirit_: When the fleshcrafter reaches 9th level, his link with his stitched flesh familiar becomes strong enough to survive after death. If a fleshcrafter creates a new stitched flesh familiar to replace a lost one, the newly created servant has all the memories of the previous one, as well as the same personality. Thus, a stitched flesh familiar created to replace one that was killed under mysterious circumstances can remember the details of its predecessor's death (including the killers, if it saw them).

**Reaper's Touch (Ex)**: At 1st level, the fleshcrafter gains such an intimate [[Knowledge]] of living things that he can increase the chances of a creature's death while appearing to heal it. When using the Heal skill to treat another creature, he may instead double any hit point or ability score damage his patient takes due to any conditions from which it already suffers. The Heal DC decreases by 5 when he uses the skill for this purpose, and the effect lasts for 24 hours. Thus, a creature with fewer than 0 hit points loses 2 hit points per round rather than 1.

Furthermore, the affected creature cannot check to stabilize as long as the creature is taking extra damage from this ability. An observer may make a Heal check opposed by the fleshcrafter's Heal check result to notice the latter's sabotage of the patient. A successful Heal check opposed by the fleshcrafter's Heal result or the application of any sort of healing magic is sufficient to halt the accelerated loss of life.

**Brink of Life and Death (Ex)**: At 5th level, the fleshcrafter gains the ability to more rapidly pinpoint the critical veins and organs he must destroy to slay a creature. Thus, he can make a coup de grace attack as a standard action. Furthermore, the fleshcrafter can extend this ability to his stitched flesh familiar as long the latter is within range of its empathic link with him. To share this ability, the fleshcrafter must concentrate on the stitched flesh famillar as a full-round action, but the coup de grace remains a standard action for the stitched flesh familiar.

**Forge Flesh**: At 10th level, the fleshcrafter unlocks the basic secrets of mimicking life. He may gather body parts to produce custom-designed animated creatures that have a vague semblance of life, such as chairs with elf legs, or racks built of outstretched arms. Such creatures count as animated objects, although they are crafted from organs, bones, and flesh taken from the fleshcrafter's victims.

For each 2 HD of the animated object to be created, the fleshcrafter must harvest body parts from one Medium creature, make a successful Craft check (DC 20), and devote 200 gp worth of chemicals, noxious fluids, and rare herbs to the creation process. When complete, the animated object obeys the fleshcrafter to the best of its ability without question. A fleshcrafter may create and control animated objects whose total HD are no more than twice his fleshcrafter level.

**Master of Life and Death (Su)**: At 15th level, the fleshcrafter perfects his understanding of life, death, and magic. His spells are so attuned to the patterns and energy of life that they are difficult for living creatures to resist. When the fleshcrafter affects a living creature (that is, any creature other than a construct or undead) with a spell, the DC for the saving throw (if any) increases by +1.

**Forge Life (Ex)**: At 20th level, the fleshcrafter can use his [[Knowledge]] of arcane magic and biology to create a flesh golem using special, rare methods that only he and others of his class can access. The fleshcrafter need spend only 5,000 gp to produce the golem, although he must still meet all the remaining prerequisites, and spend the standard amount of time and XP based on the value of the flesh golem listed in the Monster Manual. In addition, he must collect body parts from the equivalent equivalent of at least twenty different Medium humanoids that he personally killed to assemble the golem. The fleshcrafter can create any number of flesh golems in this manner.

#### Focus Caster

A familiar offers companionship and, when necessary, an effective scout or spy. It does little for your spellcasting, however. This option presents you with a less generally useful item that instead enhances your spellcasting in some way.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Instead of a familiar, you bind yourself to a masterwork item that acts as a focus for all your spells and that enhances the power of spells of one school. Once you have a masterwork item to bind to, you must perform a ritual that requires 24 hours and reagents costing 100 gp, much as if you were summoning a familiar.

When casting any spell, you must hold, wield, or wear this item (as appropriate), in addition to providing the normal components of the spell (even other foci). Your focus item is used in addition to the spell's normal components, not instead of. You are automatically considered proficient with your focus item, but you do not gain proficiency with any other item (weapon or armor) of the same type. For example, if your focus item is a longsword, you are proficient with your focus longsword but not with any other longsword, unless of course another feat or class feature grants you proficiency. When you cast a spell from the school to which your focus belongs, that spell is enhanced. At 7th and 15th levels, your focus grants additional abilities.

You may have only one focus item at a time. A specialist wizard may select only the focus appropriate to her specialty school. Bonuses gained from a focus item stack with similar bonuses gained from feats such as Spell Focus or Spell Penetration.

Your focus item grows tougher as you advance in level. The hardness of your focus item increases by one-half your caster level, up to double its normal hardness. In addition, your focus item gains additional hit points equal to your caster level, up to double its normal number of hit points. These bonuses are in addition to any increase in hardness or hit points the item gains for being made into a magic item.

If your focus item can be enhanced with magic, it costs you less XP to do so. When determining your XP cost for making your focus item into a magic item (or for upgrading it later), reduce the base cost by 10%. This reduction stacks with any other reduction you might gain, such as from the Legendary Artisan feat. Another character enhancing your focus item does not gain this reduction in XP cost.

If your focus item is destroyed, you must bind yourself to another masterwork item. You cannot bind to an item that is already a magic item. You can only bind to masterwork items. The item can be made of special materials (such as adamantine, cold iron, or darkwood).

The following items are typical foci for each of the standard schools.

_Abjuration_: Usually a set of bracers, a buckler, or a small shield (wooden or steel), your focus grants any nonpersonal abjuration spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, you may cast any personal abjuration spell as a touch spell.

_Conjuration_: Usually a gnarled and twisted quarterstaff or other polearm, your focus increases the duration of any conjuration spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 3 rounds.

_Divination_: Usually a large crystal (loose or mounted on a rod or staff) or ornate holy symbol, your focus increases the caster level of any divination spell you cast by +1. At 7th level, the duration of any divination spell you cast doubles. At 15th level, you gain a bonus to resist divinations equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).

_Enchantment_: Usually an ornate and typically nonfunctional piece of clothing, such as a sash or a hair ribbon, your focus increases the duration of any enchantment spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the DC of your enchantment spells increases by +2.

_Evocation_: Usually a bladed weapon, such as a longsword or dagger, your focus grants +1 point of damage to any evocation spell you cast. Non-area effect spells that allow multiple targets (such as magic missile) only deal the bonus damage to a single target of your choice. For example, a fireball spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer with this focus deals 6d6+1 points of damage to all creatures caught within it, while a magic missile spell cast by the same sorcerer creates three missiles: two that deal 1d4+1 points of damage and one that deals 1d4+2 points of damage. At 7th level, evocation spells you cast ignore the first 5 points of any energy or elemental resistances that a creature may have. Immunities are not affected. At 15th level, you may, once per day, ignore a creature's immunity when you cast an evocation spell that affects it.

_Illusion_: Usually a mask, shroud, cloak, or similar concealing piece of clothing, your focus increases the caster level of illusion spells you cast by +1. At 7th level, for every illusion spell you cast you gain a bonus on caster level checks made to defeat spell resistance equal to half your caster level. At 15th level, you may cast any personal illusion spell as a touch spell.

_Necromancy_: Usually a flail, kama, sickle, scythe, or other weapon derived from harvesting crops, your focus increases the range of any necromancy spell you cast by +25%. At 7th level, any necromancy spell you cast that deals ability damage, ability drain, or directly assigns a penally to an ability score deals +1 point of ability damage or ability drain or increases the penalty by an additional -1. For example, a 12th-level necromancer who casts ray of enfeeblement bestows a Strength penalty of 1d6+6 instead of the normal 1d6+5. At 15th level, any living creature affected by a necromancy spell you cast and fails the Fortitude save against it also becomes fatigued.

_Transmutation_: Usually a piece of equipment or set of tools used to create something (such as thieves' tools, a musical instrument, or artisan's tools), your focus grants any nonpersonal transmutation spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, once per day, a transmutation spell you cast that grants a bonus to ability scores doubles the bonus. For example, a bull's strength spell grants a +8 bonus to Strength instead of the normal +4.



#### Focused Specialist

Every wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic. Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level, disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus.

**Class**: Wizard.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: You must be a specialist wizard.

**Replaces**: You lose one spell slot from each level of wizard spells you can cast. If you later gain the ability to cast higher-level wizard spells, you lose one spell slot from each new level of spells you can cast.

You must also choose another prohibited school of magic, which can't be divination.

**Benefit**: You can prepare two additional spells of your specialty school per spell level each day. These extra spells are in addition to those normally granted to a specialist wizard.

This benefit doesn't apply to spells gained from classes other than wizard.

#### Gnome Illusionist

Gnomes are inherently drawn to the magic of illusion, and most gnome wizards choose to specialize in that school. As a gnome illusionist advances in level, her intimate familiarity with illusions allows her to cast certain illusion spells more easily than other wizards, to cast illusions that last longer than normal, and to make her spells harder to detect and dispel. These abilities make gnome illusionists the subtlest of all their kind and - some would argue - the most effective.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a gnome illusionist substitution level, a character must be a gnome about to take her 1st, 5th, or 10th level of illusionist.

##### Class Skills

Gnome illusionist substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Gnome Illusionist Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+0|+0|+2|Gnome illusion spells, Scribe Scroll, summon familiar|Same as illusionist|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Extended illusions|Same as illusionist|
|10th|+5|+3|+3|+7|Insidious illusions|Same as illusionist|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the gnome illusionist's racial substitution levels.

**Gnome Illusion Spells**: A gnome illusionist who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level uses her wizard level as the caster level for her racial spell-like abilities. In addition, she can prepare and cast the following illusion spells at the indicated spell level, rather than at their normal spell level:

_0 level_: Silent image, ventriloquism.

_1st level_: Leomund's trap, minor image.

_2nd level_: Illusory script, major image.

_3rd level_: Illusory wall.

_4th level_: Persistent image.

_5th level_: Programmed image.

In exchange for this benefit, a gnome illusionist must choose one of the following schools of magic from which she can cast spells (in other words, one that she has not given up access to as the price for specializing in illusion): evocation, transmutation, or conjuration. The gnome illusionist's effective caster level for spells of this school is equal to her actual caster level minus one. At 1st level, she cannot cast any spells from the selected school.

**Extended Illusions (Su)**: A gnome illusionist who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to create illusions that last longer than normal. When she casts any illusion spell that has a duration other than instantaneous, the duration of the spell is doubled. A spell with a duration of concentration lasts for the duration of the illusionist's concentration plus 1d4 rounds. A spell with a duration of concentration plus a certain increment of time lasts for the duration of the illusionist's concentration plus double that increment of time. Thus, a mirror image spell cast by a 10th-level gnome illusionist lasts for 20 minutes, a silent image spell lasts for the duration of the caster's concentration plus 1d4 rounds, a minor image spell lasts for the duration of the caster's concentration plus 4 rounds, and a mirage arcana lasts for the duration of her concentration plus 20 hours.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard wizard at 5th level, as well as the two spells a standard 5thlevel wizard learns for free.

**Insidious Illusions (Su)**: A gnome illusionist who takes the 10th-level racial substitution level can cast illusion spells that are harder for other creatures to detect or pierce. When any creature employs a divination spell, spell-like ability, or magic item (such as detect magic or true seeing) that would detect or pierce an illusion spell cast by the gnome illusionist, that creature must make a caster level check (DC 11 + the gnome illusionist's caster level) to successfully detect or pierce the illusion. The detecting creature can check only once for each divination spell or effect used, no matter how many of the gnome illusionist's illusion spells are operating in an area.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard wizard at 10th level, as well as the two spells a standard 10thlevel wizard learns for free.

#### Golarion Wizard

Wizards who train at the Arcanamirum spend much of their time studying the practical applications of their spells, often in the school's dueling fields. As such, some of them have learned the above special ability, which replaces the Scribe Scroll feat gained at 1st level.

**Arcane Duelist (Su)**: Wizards with this ability are specially trained to push their spells when needed to gain the upper hand. When pushing a spell, the wizard can choose one of the three following effects: increase a spell's DC by +1, add +2 to the level check to overcome spell resistance, or add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls made with the spell. A wizard can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus. Using this ability is a swift action.

#### Halfling Wizard

Lacking the great colleges of wizardry in which human and elven wizards learn their craft, halflings master magic by practice, curiosity, and the random accumulation of [[Knowledge]]. Halfling wizards gain a new form of versatility.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a halfling wizard substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take her 3rd, 5th, or 12th level of wizard.

##### Class Skills

Halfling wizard substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard wizard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Halfling Wizard Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3rd|+1|+1|+1|+3|Alternative spell|Same as wizard|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Lore|Same as wizard|
|12th|+6/+1|+4|+4|+8|Greater alternative spell|Same as wizard|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the halfling wizard's racial substitution levels.

**Alternative Spell (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the wizard gains a single spell known. This spell can be chosen from any 1st-level spell list, not just the wizard spell list. If this spell does not appear on the wizard spell list, treat the spell as 2nd level when prepared and cast by this wizard.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's two automatic spells learned.

**Lore (Ex)**: At 5th level, the wizard knows legends or information regarding various topics, just as a bard can with bardic [[Knowledge]]. She adds her wizard level and Intelligence modifier to the lore check, which otherwise functions like a bardic [[Knowledge]] check.

This substitution replaces the wizard's two automatic spells known and her bonus feat gained at 5th level.

**Greater Alternative Spell (Ex)**: At 12th level, the wizard gains a single spell known. This spell can be chosen from any spell list, not just the wizard spell list, but it can be no higher than 5th level. If the spell appears on the wizard spell list she must learn it at the level it appears on that list, even if it appears at a lower level on another list. If this spell does not appear on the wizard spell list, treat the spell as one level higher when prepared and cast by this wizard.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's two automatic spells learned.

#### High One Warrior-Wizard

Some paladins of Azuth belong to the Order of the Swords of the High One. These rare warriors must progress as paladins before studying wizardry fulltime, since they cannot multiclass freely. This dual focus fuses their paladin training with their wizardry.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a level of High One warrior-wizard, a character must be a member of the Swords of the High One, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), have at least two paladin levels, and be about to take her 2nd, 4th, or 5th level of wizard.

##### Class Skills

High One warrior-wizards have all the class skills that a standard wizard does, plus Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Heal, and Ride.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: High One Warrior-Wizard Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+1|+0|+0|+3|Wizardly smiting|See text|
|4th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Reduce armor hindrances|See text|
|5th|+2|+1|+1|+4|Familiar mount|See text|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the High One warrior-wizard substitution levels.

**Wizardly Smiting (Su)**: At 2nd level, a High One warrior-wizard can smite evil as a paladin. Her wizard levels stack with her paladin levels for the purpose of determining how many times per day she can use this ability.

This benefit replaces the 1st-level spell that a standard wizard gains at 2nd level. From this point forward, the character has one fewer 1st-level spells that she can prepare per day than a standard wizard does.

**Reduce Armor Hindrances (Ex)**: The High One warrior-wizard's training in spellcasting allows her to ignore some of the hindrances of armor. The arcane spell failure chance imposed by her armor is reduced by 20% (minimum 0%). Thus, she can wear light armor without penalty, or medium or heavy armor with reduced penalties.

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell that a standard wizard gains at 4th level. From this point forward, the character has one fewer 2nd-level spells that she can prepare per day than a standard wizard does.

**Familiar Mount**: If a High One warrior-wizard has access to a special mount based on her paladin levels, this creature gains the characteristics of a familiar as well as those of a paladin mount. The High One warrior-wizard must dismiss her familiar (if she has one) to gain this benefit, but she takes no penalties for doing so. She then uses her wizard level to determine the natural armor bonus, Intelligence, and special abilities that her familiar should have and applies those to her special paladin mount. Her High One warriorwizard levels count as wizard levels for this purpose.

The mount's natural armor bonuses from both sources stack, and it gains the greater of the two Intelligence scores. Thus, the mount has all the abilities of a special mount appropriate to the character's paladin level and a familiar appropriate to her wizard level. Bonuses of the same type do not stack, except as noted above, and the mount cannot gain the same ability twice; it takes the better version to which it is entitled.

The High One warrior-wizard does not lose experience points if the familiar mount is killed because she can summon a new one according to the rules given for paladins.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat that a standard wizard gains at 5th level.



#### High Specialist

Because magic plays such an important role in the game, the wizard class offers great opportunities for change when designing a campaign or a character. The following variants present different versions of the standard specialist wizards. Each variant specialist class gives up one of the standard specialists class abilities in exchange for a new ability unique to the high specialist. Each specialist class has three variants: one that replaces the specialist's summon familiar ability, one that replaces the specialist's bonus feats, and one that replaces the specialist's bonus spell per day from the specialty school.

Because each variant requires the loss of an existing ability, you can use more than one of these variants at the same time. By choosing among the variant abilities presented for each specialist, you can easily customize the way that magic works in a campaign, in a geographic region of a campaign, for a school of magic, or even for a single spellcaster. Players can easily create unique and interesting characters using these variants.

For example, a campaign might be set up with some or all of the following variants for specialist wizards.

- All abjurers in the campaign have the resistance to energy variant ability because the setting includes a large number of gates to the elemental planes.
- Evokers from a specific city all have the overcome resistance ability, but they do not gain additional spells as specialist wizards. However, other evokers in the campaign gain abilities exactly as standard evokers and consider the evokers of that city a disruptive offshoot of the pure study of magic.
- The students and masters at a college of necromancy from a distant region slowly undergo undead apotheosis instead of gaining bonus feats, but most necromancers in the campaign gain abilities exactly as standard necromancers. This difference has led some to feel that the foreign necromancers have a more thorough understanding of the powers of death. Traditional necromancers have a hard time attracting students, while the foreigners gain several new apprentices each year.
- One conjurer of particular power in the city cannot obtain a familiar and instead casts summoning spells exceptionally quickly, as described in the rapid summoning variant ability. He claims he can teach others to wield magic as he does, but so far he has gathered few students.

In addition to a description of the variant class's abilities, each entry below includes brief suggestions on sample campaigns, adventures, or characters that might benefit from the use of the high specialists. These notes are suggestions only, since nearly any campaign can benefit from adding variety to spells and spellcasters.

Although these abilities allow the creation and customization of variant classes, a character cannot, for example, take a few levels of conjurer using the rapid summoning variant and then "multiclass" into regular conjurer levels. These variants all follow the normal rules for multiclassing by specialist wizards.

##### HIGH ABJURER

Masters of protective magic, abjurers can fill many roles in a campaign, from bodyguard to battlemage to adventurer. Although it lacks offensive options, the school of abjuration provides some of the most effective combat spells in the game. An evoker or transmuter might find it easier to bring down large groups of foes, but an abjurer is far more likely to bring herself and her companions through a fight alive.

In a campaign with a high degree of intrigue or political machinations, the protective abilities of an abjurer can guard against foes both obvious and unexpected, and rival groups of abjurers, all with slightly different powers, might vie for prominence among each nation's schemers and courtiers. In combat-heavy campaigns, realms might employ abjuration specialists to protect against the battle magic of their rivals, and in any campaign, adventurers might come to rely on the skills of an abjurer to protect against the dangers of dungeon and wilderness.

**Resistance to Energy (Su)**: Once per day, an abjurer using this variant can create a mystical shield that grants herself or any one creature that she touches limited protection against a chosen energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The affected creature gains [[resistance]] equal to 5 plus one-half the abjurer's class level against the chosen energy type. Activating this ability is a standard action. Once activated, the protection lasts for 1 hour. This protection overlaps with (and does not stack with) the effects of spells such as [[resist energy]].

An abjurer using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Aura of Protection (Ex)**: Once per day, a 5th-level abjurer using this variant can generate a protective aura that shields against both physical and magical attacks. When the abjurer generates this field, she gains a deflection bonus to her Armor Class and a resistance bonus on all saving throws equal to her Intelligence modifier. This ability requires a standard action to activate, and each use protects against only one attack or spell. Once activated, the protective aura lasts for 1 minute or until the abjurer is attacked or required to make a saving throw, whichever comes first.

An abjurer using this variant can use this ability one additional time per day for every five class levels gained above 5th.

An abjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Spontaneous Dispelling (Ex)**: At 5th level, an abjurer using this variant gains the ability to spontaneously cast the spell [[dispel magic]]. This ability is similar to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure spells, with a few exceptions. The abjurer can "lose" four or more levels of prepared spells to cast dispel magic. The prepared spells can be of any level or combination of levels as long as the total spell levels add up to four or more (0-level spells don't count). For example, an abjurer using this variant could lose two 2nd-level spells or one 1st-level spell and one 3rd-level spell to cast dispel magic.

At 11th level, an abjurer can "lose" seven or more levels of prepared spells to spontaneously cast [[dispel magic greater]].

An abjurer using this variant can use it in conjunction with a readied action to use dispel magic or greater dispel magic as a counterspell.

An abjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

##### HIGH CONJURER

One of the most versatile schools of magic, conjuration offers its disciples an effective solution to nearly any task: simply summon the appropriate monster and let it solve the problem. In combat, high-level conjurers fight from behind wave after wave of summoned foes, and in most battles they simply direct their summoned allies into the conflict. In addition to these vaunted summoning powers, conjuration provides effective combat spells and access to teleportation magic.

While virtually any campaign can benefit from rival groups of conjurers serving diverse agendas, conjurers are particularly effective in combat-heavy campaigns. Campaigns that feature a great deal of long-distance travel or travel between planes also benefit from including diverse groups of conjurers, because their specialty facilitates travel and encourages a thorough understanding of the creatures of the Outer Planes.

**Rapid Summoning (Ex)**: Any time a conjurer using this variant casts a [[summon monster i|summon monster]] spell, its casting time is 1 standard action rather than 1 full round. (Creatures so summoned can only take a standard action in the round they are summoned.) Conjurers using this variant gain the normal benefits from enhancing a summon monster spell with the [[Quicken Spell]] feat.

A conjurer using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Enhanced Summoning (Ex)**: At 1st level, a conjurer using this variant gains the [[Augment Summoning]] feat for free instead of the [[Scribe Scroll]] feat.

At 5th level, the conjurer's summoned creatures become particularly tough to [[dispel]]. Add 2 to the DC of any caster level check made to dispel the conjurer's summoned creatures. At 15th level, this addition to the DC increases to 4.

At 10th level, the conjurer's summoned creatures gain an additional +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution. At 20th level, these bonuses increase to +4. These bonuses stack with those granted by the [[Augment Summoning]] feat.

A conjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Spontaneous Summoning (Ex)**: Conjurers using this variant can "lose" a prepared spell to cast any [[summon monster i|summon monster]] spell of a lower level. For example, a conjurer who has prepared [[greater invisibility]] (a 4th-level spell) may lose that spell to cast [[summon monster I]], [[summon monster II]], or [[summon monster III]].

A conjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

_Note:_ Since conjurers using this variant obviously summon monsters frequently, the game master should require the conjurer's player to prepare simple record sheets ahead of time for each monster that the character commonly summons. It is also important to emphasize speedy play on the part of the conjurer and his summoned monsters.

##### HIGH DIVINER

Seekers of [[Knowledge]], hoarders of lore, and master spies, diviners are perhaps the most underrated specialist wizards. Because they must give up access to only one other school of magic, they are also the most versatile specialists. More than any other specialists, diviners excel at gathering information, and an adventuring party that includes a diviner is much more likely to prepare properly for an adventure.

Many campaigns benefit from featuring more than one type of divination specialist, and diviners can play important parts in any game revolving around information gathering. Campaigns that feature mysteries and detective-style adventures, themes of prophecy and oracles, or large amounts of social interaction and espionage all make excellent forums for a diviner's powers. In campaigns that feature high diviners with different class abilities, one simple way to add more variety is to make each distinct group of specialists experts in and proponents of a different form of divination. In game terms, this divergence is represented by altering the material components for some divination spells. For example, one group of diviners might favor osteomancy and require a collection of bones to use as components for their spells.

**Enhanced Awareness (Ex)**: A diviner using this variant adds [[Sense Motive]] to her list of class skills. In addition, she gains minor benefits when casting certain divination spells.

She needs only to study an item for 10 minutes (rather than 1 hour) when casting [[identify]].

An [[arcane eye]] cast by the diviner travels at 20 feet per round when studying its surroundings (rather than 10 feet per round).

Add +1 to the saving throw DCs of the character's divination spells. (This bonus stacks with the bonus from the [[Spell Focus]] and [[Greater Spell Focus]] feats.)

A diviner using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Bonus Feat List**: A diviner using this variant gradually grows in awareness and perceptive ability, but at the expense of her metamagic capabilities. The diviner may not select a [[metamagic feat]] as a wizard bonus feat (that is, those feats gained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level). However, the following feats are added to the list of bonus feats available to her at those levels: [[Alertness]], [[Blind-Fight]], [[Improved Initiative]], [[Lightning Reflexes]], and [[Skill Focus]] ([[Spot]], [[Listen]], or [[Sense Motive]] only).

**Prescience (Ex)**: Gifted with extraordinary insight and perceptive abilities, a diviner using this variant can add an insight bonus equal to her Intelligence modifier to any attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or level check she makes. The diviner can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every five class levels attained. Using this ability is a free action that can be taken out of turn if needed, but the character must choose to use this ability before the die roll is made.

A diviner using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

##### HIGH ENCHANTER

Charmer, schemer, deceiver, pacifist: an enchanter can be all these and more. As a practitioner of one of the most subtle schools of magic, an enchanter might charm a guard into opening a well-defended gate that fifty warriors couldn't take by force. Good-aligned enchanters use their powers to seek out truth and encourage others onto the path of good, while their evil counterparts bend others' minds at their whim and gather personal power as rapidly as possible.

Campaigns that feature a large amount of social scenarios, political intrigue, or investigation benefit greatly from the inclusion of high enchanters. These spellcasters, skilled in the manipulation of others and capable of concealing their own identities, make excellent villains and manipulators, or even investigators skilled at using magic to draw the truth out of opponents.

Players and game masters alike should also consider the ramifications that enchantment spells and similar effects have on a game world. Is casting [[charm person]] legal? Is a character legally responsible for actions taken while charmed? Do most of the campaign's inhabitants know that enchantment effects exist? Are there folk remedies that supposedly provide protection against enchantment effects? Do they actually work? Having ready answers to these and similar questions not only adds consistency to the game, but also clarifies and highlights the role of the enchanter.

**Cohort**: Upon reaching 6th level, an enchanter using this variant gains the service of a loyal cohort of the player's choice (with the game master's approval). The cohort is a 4th-level character when first gained; after that point, follow the normal rules described in the [[Leadership]] feat to determine the cohort's level, but treat the enchanter's level as being two lower than normal.

The enchanter doesn't gain any followers from this ability. If the enchanter selects the [[Leadership]] feat, he attracts followers as normal, the penalty to the enchanter's effective level is eliminated, and the enchanter automatically qualifies for the "special power" modifier to his Leadership score.

An enchanter using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Social Proficiency (Ex)**: Enchanters using this variant are as proficient at manipulating others through mundane means as they are at influencing their minds magically. Add the following skills to the character's list of wizard class skills: [[Bluff]], [[Diplomacy]], [[Gather Information]], [[Intimidate]], and [[Sense Motive]]. The enchanter also gains a +2 competence bonus on checks involving one of these skills (player's choice) every five levels (5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th). This bonus can only be applied once to each skill.

An enchanter using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Extended Enchantment (Su)**: Enchanters using this variant ensnare the minds of others more easily with their magic, and as a result their enchantment spells last longer than those cast by other spellcasters. Once per day, plus one additional time per two class levels gained above 1st, an enchanter using this variant can cast a spell from the enchantment school as if it were enhanced by the [[Extend Spell]] metamagic feat. This enhancement does not affect the spell's level.

This ability cannot be used to extend a spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent.

An enchanter using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

##### HIGH EVOKER

Masters of the raw power of magical energy, evokers can turn the tide of a battle with a single powerful spell, leveling groups of foes faster than any other practitioner of magic. Where some wizards focus on careful spell preparation and protective spells to survive combat encounters, evokers simply blast away with powerful energy attacks. Their prodigious offensive abilities ensure that evokers become the center of an adventuring group's battle plan.

Campaigns that include large numbers of wizards aligned to different nations are particularly suitable for high evokers, since each nation develops unique cadres of evokers to serve in battle. Groups of militant evokers marching in unison with more conventional groups can change the tide of nearly any battle. In addition, campaigns that include themes of primal energy, raw nature, or extreme elemental conditions can all benefit from introducing evokers with variant abilities. Evokers in these sorts of campaigns might explore the raw essence of magic, struggling to harness its energies in new and unique ways.

**Energy Affinity (Ex)**: Evokers using this variant must choose an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This choice is made upon character creation and cannot be altered thereafter. Any time the character casts an evocation spell with the chosen energy type, she casts the spell as if her caster level were one higher (affecting range, duration, damage, caster level checks, and any other factor influenced by caster level).

An evoker using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Energy Substitution (Ex)**: An evoker of 5th level or higher using this variant can substitute energy of one type for another. When casting a spell that has an energy descriptor (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the evoker can change the energy descriptor and the spell's effects to energy of a different type.

Using this ability is a free action that must be declared before the spell is cast. The evoker can use this ability once per day for each five class levels he has attained (1/day at 5th, 2/day at 10th, and so on).

An evoker using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Overcome Resistance (Ex)**: The energy spells of an evoker using this variant can ignore some or all of a target's [[resistance to energy]]. Using this ability is a free action that must be announced before the evoker casts the spell to be affected. Every creature affected by the spell is treated as if its resistance to the spell's energy type was 10 points lower, to a minimum of 0. (This lowered resistance applies only to this spell; other effects with the same energy descriptor must get through the creature's normal resistance.)

The overcome resistance ability does not give the affected spell any ability to affect creatures with immunity to the spell's energy type, nor does the affected spell have any additional effect on creatures that do not have resistance to energy.

An evoker may use this ability one time per day, plus one additional time per day for every two class levels attained beyond 1st (2/day at 3rd, 3/day at 5th, and so forth).

An evoker using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.


##### HIGH ILLUSIONIST

Illusionists control their surroundings by shaping, distorting, and deceiving the perceptions of others. To some their abilities seem weak, because they only distort and disguise rather than effecting true change, but those affected by an illusionist's spells know better, understanding that their own senses can be turned against them at any time.

Campaigns that deal in deception or that have a high level of social interaction, a fair number of mystery adventures, or even simply suspicious players can benefit from the introduction of high illusionists. Campaigns featuring multiple types of high illusionists might give each group or variant an even more distinctive flavor by making each the master of a particular subset of illusion spells. Illusionists from one nation might, for example, have the chains of disbelief variant ability and favor phantasms, while the illusionist thieves of the Guild of Shadows might have the shadow shaper variant ability and favor glamers and shadow magic.

**Chains of Disbelief (Ex)**: Even if a viewer disbelieves an illusion created by an illusionist using this variant and communicates the details of the illusion to other creatures, those other creatures do not receive the normal +4 bonus on their saying throws to disbelieve the illusion. Furthermore, even when presented with incontrovertible proof that the illusion isn't real, creatures must still succeed on a Will saving throw to see objects or creatures that the illusion obscures, although they get a +10 bonus on the saving throw.

An illusionist using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Shadow Shaper**: An illusionist using this variant has a special bond with the [[Plane of Shadow]], and gains several special abilities as he advances in level.

At 1st level, [[Hide]] is treated as a class skill for the illusionist.

At 5th level, the illusionist may add his Intelligence modifier (in addition to his Dexterity modifier) to his [[Hide]] skill checks.

At 10th level the illusionist's illusions become infused with shadow stuff from the [[Plane of shadow]], making them more realistic and more likely to fool the senses. The save DCs of the illusionist's illusion spells increase by +1. This benefit stacks with similar bonuses, such as from [[Spell Focus]].

At 15th level, the illusionist can hide in plain sight (as the [[ranger]] ability, except that the illusionist need not be in natural terrain).

At 20th level, the illusionist gains the ability to blend into shadows. In any condition of illumination that would normally grant the illusionist concealment, he instead gains total concealment (as if he were [[invisible]]).

An illusionist using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Illusion Mastery (Ex)**: An illusionist using this variant automatically adds two illusion spells to his spellbook every time he gains a level that grants access to a new spell level. Furthermore, any time the illusionist learns a new illusion spell, he treats that spell as if be had mastered it with the [[Spell Mastery]] feat.

An illusionist using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

##### HIGH NECROMANCER

Wrapped in mystery and burdened by reputations of evil, necromancers control dangerous energies that rob the living of strength and grant unlife to the dead. The most powerful necromancers command dangerous undead minions and threaten towns, cities, and sometimes even entire kingdoms with their power. Although necromancers make excellent villains and nemeses for a group of adventurers, neutral- and good-aligned necromancers who view themselves as the shepherds of the living and guardians of the dead can also prove valuable allies.

Campaigns that include evil necromancers or groups of undead as antagonists can benefit from the inclusion of high necromancers. Rival groups of necromancers might view certain types of undead as the only true or "pure" undead and all others as evils that must be destroyed, with each group disagreeing on which types are which. Other factions or groups might have an innate loathing for undead raised by any but themselves.

**Skeletal Minion**: A 1st-level necromancer using this variant can begin play with an undead minion (a human warrior [[skeleton]]). Obtaining this minion takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp.

This creature is a loyal servant that follows the necromancer's commands and accompanies her on adventures if desired. If the skeletal minion is destroyed, the necromancer suffers no ill effects and may replace it by performing a ceremony identical to the one that allowed her to obtain her first servant.

At 1st level, the skeleton is completely typical, but it gains power as the necromancer gains levels. The skeleton has a number of Hit Dice equal to the necromancer's class level. Add one-half the necromancer's class level to the skeleton's natural armor bonus. Add one-third of the necromancer's class level to the skeleton's Strength and Dexterity scores.

A necromancer using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Undead Apotheosis (Ex)**: As a necromancer using this variant progresses in levels, she gains some of the qualities that typify undead creatures.

At 5th level, the necromancer gains a 2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist sleep, [[stun]], [[paralysis]], [[poison]], or [[disease]]. This bonus increases to +4 at 15th level.

At 10th level, the necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist [[ability damage]], [[ability drain]], or [[energy drain]].

At 20th level, the necromancer gains 25% resistance to critical hits, as the light fortification [[armor special ability]].

A necromancer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Enhanced Undead (Ex)**: Any time a necromancer using this variant creates an undead creature (such as with [[animate dead]], [[create undead]], or [[create greater undead]]), all undead creatures created gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, and two additional hit points per Hit Die. This ability does not affect the number or Hit Dice of animated creatures that the necromancer can create or control.

A necromancer using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

##### HIGH TRANSMUTER

Masters of change, transmuters are among the most varied and versatile specialists. Transmutation spells, by their very nature, can change the environment and allow the spellcaster to solve nearly any problem.

This school's utility and variety ensures that nearly any campaign's magic becomes richer with the introduction of high transmuters. Campaigns in which the magic system is undergoing change benefit from introducing high transmuters. Likewise, campaigns that include an above-average number of magical cultures or a long history of magical sophistication benefit from alternative traditions of transmutation magic.

**Enhance Attribute (Ex)**: Once per day, plus one additional time per five class levels, a transmuter using this variant can add a +2 enhancement bonus to any one of his ability scores. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to the transmuter's class level. Using this ability is a free action (and counts as using a [[quickened]] spell, so it may only be used once per round).

A transmuter using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

**Spell Versatility (Ex)**: A 5th-level transmuter using this variant can adapt magic of other schools to his own style of spellcasting. For every five class levels that the transmuter gains, he can select one spell of any spell level that he has access to and treat it as if it were a transmutation spell. This means, for example, that the specialist can learn the spell normally and even prepare it as a bonus spell from the transmutation school. This spell can even be from a school that he has chosen as a prohibited school. Once a spell is chosen to be affected by this ability, it cannot be changed.

For example, a transmutation specialist using this variant has selected abjuration and necromancy as his prohibited schools. At 5th level, he gains access to 3rd-level spells. He chooses [[dispel magic]] and forever after treats dispel magic as if were a transmutation spell.

A transmuter using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

**Transmutable Memory (Ex)**: A transmuter using this variant can alter some of his prepared spells in a short amount of time. Once per day, the transmuter can give up a number of prepared spell levels (up to a maximum total equal to half his class level) and prepare different spells in their place, as long as the number of newly prepared spell levels is equal to or less than the number of spell levels given up (0-level spells don't count). For example, a 12th-level transmuter who uses this variant can lose two 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells from memory (a total of six spell levels, half the character's class level) and prepare two 3rd-level spells.

Using this ability requires a number of minutes of concentration equal to the number of spell levels given up. if the transmuter's concentration is broken during this time, all spells to be lost are gone and no spells are gained in their place.

A transmuter using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

#### Imbued Staff

As an optional rule, any sorcerer or wizard may opt to forego a normal familiar in order to imbue her traveling staff with that portion of her power. To do this, she selects a quarterstaff-length of wood that resonates with her mystical signature and personality. It cannot have been previously enchanted (although it may subsequently be) and must be of masterwork quality. It must be prepared using materials costing at least 500 gp, usually with a gem to serve as a mounted finial. The imbuing ritual takes 24 hours and ties a portion of the spellcaster's power into the staff, a separate piece of her soul that grows in power as she does. Upon its imbuing, the staff becomes magically linked to its creator and is treated as a magic item.

**Hit Points**: The staff has 10 Hit Points and Hardness 5, both of which increase as the wizard or sorcerer gains levels, according to the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

**Saving Throws**: The staff saves as its creator, even when unattended.

If an imbued staff is broken, its creator must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or lose 500 experience points per wizard or sorcerer level. Success reduces the loss by half. However, a caster's experience point total can never be reduced below 0 as a result of the loss of her staff. A broken imbued staff cannot be replaced for a year and a day - the loss is too great.

If the character who imbued the staff dies, the staff loses all magical properties. Should the character return from the grave, it regains its imbued powers when it is first touched by the imbuing character.

**Table: Imbued Staff Advancement**

|Master  <br>Class Level|Hardness|Hit Points|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st-2nd|5|15|Cantrips, deliver touch spells|

##### Imbued Ability Descriptions

An imbued staff has special capabilities depending on its master's wizard or sorcerer level, as shown on the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

**Cantrips (Sp)**: Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder of the staff can make it shed a flickering light as per the spell. Once activated, this light remains until the wielder dismisses it (a free action). In addition, the staff can hold a single cantrip available to the wielder, decided upon when it is first imbued. Once per day, as a standard action, the master can cast this cantrip from the staff. The caster level for these effects is equal to that of the master. The save DC for any cantrip cast by the staff is 10.

**Deliver Touch Spells (Su)**: The master may deliver touch spells with the staff. When using the staff in this way, the wielder may attempt to deal the staffs damage by hitting the target's standard AC (as opposed to the target's touch AC). A successful critical hit with the staff does not double the spell's affect when delivered in this way.

**Enhanced Weapon (Su)**: The staff gains the listed enhancement bonus to attack and damage when wielded by its master. This bonus applies to both ends of the staff. In the hands of any other it is merely an ordinary masterwork staff.

**Remote Viewing (Su)**: The staff's master may concentrate and view the staff's surroundings as though looking through the finial. This effect is identical to that of clairvoyance except that it lasts for as long as the owner concentrates and has an infinite range so long as the staff is on the same plane. While in effect, the staff's finial glows faintly, illuminating the area around the staff like a candle.

**Vital Transfer (Su)**: The staff's master may opt to forego her natural healing for the evening and mend her staff through mystical means. Each night's rest thus spent returns a number of hit points to the staff equal to the master's character level, up to the staff's maximum hit points. The Heal skill does not increase this amount.

**Perfect Location (Su)**: By concentrating for a full round, the wizard knows the direction and distance to her staff, so long as it is on the same plane.

**Mighty Weapon (Su)**: The staff gains the bane, defending, flaming, frost, merciful, shock, or thundering special weapon ability. This ability applies to both ends of the staff. Once chosen, the bonus cannot be changed and does not function in the hands of anyone other than the staff's master.

**Return (Su)**: The master can summon the staff to her hand as a standard action, so long as it is on the same plane. When summoned in this way, the staff simply appears in its master's hand. Any effect targeting the staff or the master that prevents teleportation also blocks this ability.

##### Invested Symbol of Power

Once a staff has been imbued with a wizard's power, the spellcaster can further enhance it through feats like Enchant Staff, Imbued Defense, Imbued Strength, Invest Spell, and Recharge Staff. These feats each require further preparation and ornamentation of the staff, and as such are classified as item creation feats.

##### Enhancing an Imbued Staff

A wizard with the Craft Staff feat wishing to add powers to her imbued staff as if it were a normal staff may do so, however all costs associated with its creation are increased by 20%. This reflects the difficulty in overlaying the newer abilities with the existing powers. A staff crafted in this manner is created with 50 charges. It retains any imbued powers and its magical nature, even after the charges are expended.


#### Immediate Magic

Other than having a single additional spell of each spell level, a specialist wizard functions like any other wizard. Your evoker's fireball spell deals as much damage as that of a conjurer, diviner, or necromancer, and doesn't look any different. By taking the immediate magic alternative class feature, you gain a useful trick that sets you apart from other specialists. Though giving up your familiar is a hardship, it means you have one less thing to worry about in a fight.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: You gain a supernatural ability that reflects your chosen school of magic. Activating this ability is an immediate action, and you can use this supernatural ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Its equivalent spell level is equal to one-half your wizard level (minimum 1st), and the caster level is your wizard level. The save DC (if any) is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Int modifier.

You can't activate this ability in response to an attack that you aren't aware of. For instance, if an invisible rogue strikes at you, you can't activate urgent shield to gain a bonus to your AC against the attack. All effects last until the start of your next turn unless otherwise noted.

To select this ability, you must also choose to specialize in a school of magic. The supernatural ability gained depends on your specialty (see below).

_Urgent Shield (abjuration)_: You create a temporary shield of force that grants you a +2 shield bonus to AC.

_Abrupt Jaunt (conjuration)_: You teleport up to 10 feet. You can't bring along any other creatures.

_Glimpse Peril (divination)_: You get a flash of foresight into the danger lying in your future. You gain a +2 insight bonus on the next saving throw you make before your next turn.

_Instant Daze (enchantment)_: When an enemy that has HD equal to or less than your wizard level makes a melee attack against you, you can render him dazed (Will negates). This is a compulsion, mind-affecting ability.

_Counterfire (evocation)_: When a visible enemy within 60 feet targets you with a ranged attack or spell, you can respond with a glowing arrow of force. This requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of damage per three wizard levels. Both attacks resolve simultaneously (neither can disrupt the other).

_Brief Figment (illusion)_: You create a figment double of yourself (similar to mirror image). The image lasts until it is struck or until the start of your next turn.

_Cursed Glance (necromancy)_: When a visible enemy within 60 feet targets you with an attack or spell, you can respond with a curse. If the enemy fails a Will save, he takes a -2 penalty to AC and on saving throws.

_Sudden Shift (transmutation)_: You temporarily change your form to grant yourself a climb, fly, or swim speed equal to your current land speed. If you activate this ability during your turn, it lasts until the end of that turn; otherwise it lasts until the end of your next turn.

#### Impromptu Metamagic

Sorcerers typically seek to maximize their limited spell selection by utilizing metamagic feats. Other arcane spellcasters also adjust their spells with these feats in order to keep their enemies guessing or to find added flexibility for their lower-level spells. This ability allows you to spontaneously apply metamagic feats to your spells.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Each day, you may choose a metamagic feat you have. You can cast spells affected by that feat without increasing the spell level or casting time of the spells. You may not use any other metamagic feats that day. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 5 minus the level adjustment of the metamagic feat. (Thus, you may use Quicken Spell in this way once per day, while you could use Silent Spell four times per day.)

You may apply the metamagic feat spontaneously, as you cast the spell. If you prepare spells, you do not need to prepare the spells with the metamagic feat already applied.

Even though this ability does not increase the spell's level, you must be able to cast spells of the level the spell would be if you applied the metamagic feat normally. For example, a quickened magic missile would normally require a 5th-level spell slot. With this ability you may cast a quickened magic missile as a 1st-level spell, but you must still be able to cast 5th-level spells.

#### Planar Wizard

While other spellcasters may have a vested interest in a particular planar viewpoint, the wizard prefers a more open policy toward the planes. To a wizard, the planes represent [[Knowledge]] and power, and the wizard who can learn the secrets of the planes without regard to those planes' alignments or other traits is a true master of magic.

More so than many other classes, the wizard already has the ability to customize her abilities with an eye to the planes, simply through the spells she learns and prepares each day. If a wizard learns plane shift and planar tolerance, then the caster is self-customized to adventure on the planes. But the planar wizard goes a step beyond this adaptation, learning to channel the pure power of the planes themselves in her spells.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Requirements

To take a wizard planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 6th, 10th, or 14th level of wizard.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Wizard planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Wizard Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|6th|+3|+2|+2|+5|Unimpeded magic|See text|
|10th|+5|+3|+3|+7|Planar spellcasting|See text|
|14th|+7/+2|+4|+4|+9|Enhanced magic|See text|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the wizard's planar substitution levels.

**Unimpeded Magic (Su)**: A 6th-level planar wizard learns to overcome planar impediments to her spellcasting. When casting a wizard spell that would normally be impeded because of a plane's magic traits (such as a fire spell on the Elemental Plane of Water), the spell functions normally without need for a Spellcraft check.

This benefit replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard wizard at 6th level. From now on, the wizard can prepare one less 3rd-level wizard spell than indicated on Table: The Wizard.

**Planar Spellcasting (Su)**: A 10th-level planar wizard learns to channel planar energy through her spells. Upon gaining this ability, the wizard chooses to make her spells anarchic (chaotic), axiomatic (lawful), celestial (good), or fiendish (evil). Her spells gain the indicated alignment descriptor. The wizard can choose any of the four options, regardless of her own alignment. Against creatures of the opposed alignment, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and her spell save DCs are increased by 1. If she casts a spell that normally has the same alignment descriptor that she would apply, or whenever she casts a spell on a plane with an alignment trait that matches the alignment she chose, the bonuses increase to +2. These effects apply only to the character's wizard spells; any spellcasting ability gained from another class functions normally.

For example, the spells of a wizard choosing to cast fiendish spells gain the evil descriptor. She gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of good-aligned creatures, and good-aligned creatures attempting to save against her spells do so against a DC that is 1 higher than normal. If she casts a spell that would normally be an evil spell (such as contagion), or if she casts any spell on an evil-aligned plane (such as the Abyss or the Nine Hells), these values would increase by 2 instead of by 1.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard wizard at 10th level, as well as the two spells a standard 10th-level wizard learns for free.

**Enhanced Magic (Su)**: A 14th-level planar wizard learns how to channel the essence of a specific plane's enhanced magic trait through her spells. Upon gaining this ability, the wizard must choose a specific plane that she has visited (other than the Material Plane). Three times per day, the wizard may spend a standard action to channel that plane's magical essence. The next spell she casts (if cast within 1 minute) is enhanced as if she were casting it on that plane, applying any magic traits normal to that plane. This ability doesn't apply any other planar magic traits to the wizard's spells, such as wild magic or impeded magic.

For example, a planar wizard who chose to channel the essence of the Elemental Plane of Fire would maximize and enlarge the next spell she cast after activating this ability (as if she had applied the Maximize Spell and Enlarge Spell meta magic feats, but without adjusting the spell slot used), as long as that spell has the fire descriptor.

This benefit replaces the 7th-level spell slot gained by a standard wizard at 14th level. From now on, the wizard can prepare one less 7th-level wizard spell than indicated on Table: The Wizard.

#### School Mastery

Some specialist wizards take their mastery to whole new levels. Occasionally, even sorcerers and other arcane spellcasters focus their attentions on one school over the others. Your expertise in a chosen school of magic is unparalleled.

**Level**: 1st (4th for hexblades).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: Choose a school of magic. If you are already a specialist wizard, you may only choose the school in which you are specialized. You cast all spells from the chosen school at +1 caster level. In addition, you gain the following benefit, based on the school you select.

_Abjuration_: Any non-instantaneous, nonpermanent abjuration spell you cast on someone other than yourself that does not require concentration has double the duration. You cannot use this ability on any spell whose duration you affect in any other way, such as with the Extend Spell metamagic feat.

_Conjuration_: Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Wisdom for the duration of the spell that summoned it.

_Divination_: Whenever you cast a divination spell, you immediately gain a +2 insight bonus on Listen and Spot skill checks for 1 hour per level of the spell you cast (0-level spells grant the bonus for 30 minutes).

_Enchantment_: For 24 hours after an enchantment spell you cast expires, the target of your spell takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made to resist your spells or spell-like abilities. You may affect only one creature at a time in this way. If your enchantment spell affected multiple targets, you must choose one creature against whom the penalty applies. Whenever an enchantment spell you cast expires while such a penally is active, the old penalty immediately disappears.

_Evocation_: Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, that spell deals +1 point of damage.

_Illusion_: Whenever you cast an illusion (shadow) spell that creates a partially real effect (such as shadow conjuration or shadow evocation), the effect is 10% more real than normal. Thus, a creature created by shadow conjuration is 30% as strong as a real creature of the same kind, instead of the normal 20%.

_Necromancy_: Each undead creature you create with any evil spell gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level. These temporary hit points last indefinitely, only disappearing when your creation takes damage. They cannot be regained once lost.

_Transmutation_: Whenever you cast a spell that alters a creature's form, kind, or type, the DC to resist the spell increases by +1.

#### Soul Reaper

Most necromancers care little for the living, regarding them at best as potential sources of new undead servitors and at worst as inconvenient meddlers. The soul reaper takes a radically different approach. Rather than use her magic to expand the power of death, she crafts spells to breach the barrier between the living and the dead. By peering into the cosmic ether, the soul reaper can snatch a creature's spirit in the split second that it hovers between the material world and the afterlife.

By collecting souls in this manner and using obscene rituals to torment and enslave them, the soul reaper can expand her arcane power and conquer her enemies more easily. For this reason, she is perhaps the most feared of the dark magi. A fleshcrafter may kill one or more victims to produce a new servant, but the creature so formed is only an animated physical shell - the life forces of the victims themselves pass on to the afterlife. Other necromancers traffic with evil spirits and mindless undead, but only the soul reaper routinely denies her victims their final reward. Trapped within her service, suspended between life and death, they endure a terrible, lonely existence in which they cater to the whims of a power-hungry wizard. When a diabolical fiend must permanently remove an opponent, he calls upon a soul reaper to trap his foe's spirit. Even a cleric's power to raise the dead fails to function on a soul trapped within a ruby that a soul reaper has tossed into the sea.

**Alignment**: Any evil.

**Hit Die**: d4.

##### Class Skills

The soul reaper's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Knowledge]] (all skills, taken individually) (Int), [[Profession]] (Wis), and [[SpellCraft]] (Int).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the soul reaper.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Like most arcane spellcasters, a soul reaper receives only minimal training with weapons and none with armor. She is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a soul reaper's movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A soul reaper casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list in the Player's Handbook. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time, like a wizard. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a soul reaper must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a soul reaper's spell is 10 + the spell level the soul reaper's Intelligence modifier.

Like a wizard, a soul reaper can cast only a certain number of arcane spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on the table for her class. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

All soul reapers function as necromancer specialist wizards for the purpose of spellcasting. They must specialize in necromancy and choose prohibited schools as per the standard rules for specialist wizards.

**Spellbooks**: A soul reaper must record her spells in thick books. Each morning, she pores over these tomes to prepare her spells for use later in the day. The soul reaper can prepare read magic from memory, but all other spells must appear in her spellbooks before she can prepare them. A soul reaper gains all 0-level wizard spells (except for those from prohibited schools) at 1st level. In addition, she gains three 1st-level spells and an additional number equal to her Intelligence bonus. Thereafter, each time the soul reaper achieves a new level, she gains two new spells of any level or levels that her new level allows him to cast.

Like a wizard, a soul reaper may select the Spell Mastery feat.

**Inquisitor of the Grave (Sp)**: At 1st level, the soul reaper learns to force information from the recently departed soul of a fresh corpse. Once per day, the soul reaper can use speak with dead as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effects of the speak with dead spell. The soul reaper must follow all the guidelines and restrictions associated with casting that spell.

**Spiritual Vassal**: The soul reaper can compel obedience from a host of spirits that she has seized through a foul ceremony and combined into a single spiritual vassal. This ghostly apparition has little effect on the physical world, but besides acting as a familiar, it grants the reaper some of the [[Knowledge]] the souls used to create it held in life.

A soul reaper dominates and controls the spirits that make up the vassal through a vile ritual that requires 100 gp worth of materials (primarily blood and bone taken from outsiders) and a humanoid creature slain via a ritual sacrifice. After killing her victim, the soul reaper can open a magical link to the afterlife, compel a number of minor spirits to enter the material world, and force them into her service. These spirits combine to form a single entity known as a spiritual vassal that obeys the soul reaper's every command - primarily because it faces terrible repercussions if it refuses to do so. As a free action, a soul reaper can induce wracking agony in her vassal, causing it to howl in pain. The pain immobilizes the vassal (no save) until the reaper wills the effect to end (also a free action). This pitiable creature might moan for an end to its horrid existence even as it moves to oppose the soul reaper's foes.

While the spiritual vassal serves the soul reaper, it is as loyal and trustworthy as a standard wizard's familiar. If it is destroyed, the soul reaper suffers the same drawbacks as a wizard does if her familiar is slain. The spiritual vassal gains all the abilities indicated on the Spiritual Vassal Special Abilities table, based on its master's level. Many of these are the standard abilities of a familiar, but a few are unique to the spiritual vassal. The spiritual vassal also gains all the abilities described under "Familiar Basics" in the [[Familiars]] section. Spiritual vassals are rarely encountered without a master. The statistics provided here, for an unbonded vassal, should only actually be used if the vassal's master is slain and it manages to survive. Unbonded vassals constantly whimper and softly moan of their despair, begging any creatures they encounter to end their miserable existence and send the souls trapped in their bodies back to the afterlife.

_Spiritual Vassal (unbonded)_: CR -; Tiny undead; HD 1/2d12; hp 3; Init +1; Spd 10 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect); AC 14 (+2 size, +1 Dex, +1 natural armor), touch 13, flat-footed 13; BAB +0, Grp -8; Atk +1 melee (1-1, slam); Full Atk +1 melee (1-1, slam); SA -; SQ undead traits; AL N: SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +3; Str 8, Dex 12, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10.

A spiritual vassal looks like a small sphere of pale, glowing light. Those unfamiliar with soul reapers and their servants might mistake one for a will-o'-wisp. When in combat or forced to perform some other unpleasant task, spiritual vassals moan in inarticulate whispers of their pain and misery. Up close, shadowy faces - the spirits of the unfortunate souls bound into the vassal - occasionally appear and fade on the surface of the orb.

**Table: Spiritual Vassal Special Abilities**

|Master  <br>Class Level|Natural  <br>Armor Adj.|Int|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st-2nd|+1|10|Alertness, empathic link, improved evasion, share spells|
|3rd-4th|+2|11|Deliver touch spells|
|5th-6th|+3|12|Speak with master|
|7th-8th|+4|13|—|
|9th-10th|+5|14|—|
|11th-12th|+6|15|Spell resistance|

|15th-16th|+8|17|—|
|17th-18th|+9|18|—|
|19th-20th|+10|19|—|

  

**Ancestral [[Knowledge]] (Sp)**: The spiritual vassal can draw on its memories from life to provide the reaper with advice, skills, and abilities on a temporary basis. Starting at 5th level, the soul reaper can access her spiritual vassal's memories, gaining one of the abilities described below (reaper's choice) once per day. She gains one additional selection per day at 9th level, another at 13th level, and a fourth at 17th level. The soul reaper may mix and match the abilities as desired within her usage allotment. For example, a 17th-level soul reaper could use the memories of past lives ability four times, or memories of past lives twice and talents of the elders twice, or any combination of the three abilities that adds up to four uses. The reaper's spiritual vassal must be able to communicate with her for this ability to function.

_Memories of Past Lives_: Drawing on her spiritual vassal's memories, the soul reaper gains a +5 competence bonus on checks made with a skill of her choice. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.

_Speech of the Ancients_: The soul reaper gains the ability to speak and read a language of her choice for 1 minute.

_Talents of the Elders_: The soul reaper gains temporary access to a feat of her choice for which she meets the prerequisites. She can use the feat for 1 minute.

**Bind Spirit (Su)**: At 5th level, the soul reaper may attempt to capture the spirit of a dying creature in a gem or crystal worth at least 500 gp. This entrapment requires a standard action, and the soul reaper must ready her action to use it at the moment her victim reaches -10 hit points or is destroyed. The victim may attempt a Will save (DC 15 + the soul reaper's Intelligence modifier) to resist the binding. On a failed save, the victim's spirit is trapped in the gem, where it must remain for 1 day per level the soul reaper possesses in this class, or until the gem is broken or destroyed. As long as the soul is in the gem, the victim cannot be restored to life in any manner. The victim's soul cannot be communicated with or contacted in any way, with the exception of the soul reaper abilities described below.

The soul reaper can choose to use any one of the following benefits once per day while the soul is within the gem.

- Compel the bound soul to answer one yes or no question truthfully.
- Speak any one language the bound soul knows for 1 hour.
- Choose any one skill the bound soul possesses and use its ranks in that skill in place of her own for 1 minute. The soul reaper is considered trained in the use of the skill.

Whether or not the reaper actually uses one of these options, the soul is automatically released at the end of the ability's duration. If the gem or crystal is destroyed, the soul is freed immediately.

**Bonus Feat**: At 10th level, the soul reaper gains a bonus feat. She may choose any metamagic, item creation, or necromantic feat for which she meets the prerequisites. She gains another such bonus feat at 20th level.

**Spawn Undead Servitor**: At 15th level, the soul reaper gains the dreaded ability to force a soul captured via her bind spirit ability to inhabit the body of a skeleton or zombie. By completing a ritual that costs 500 gp per Hit Die of the skeleton or zombie, the reaper can permanently grant it the trapped soul's base attack bonus (if higher than its current one), skill ranks, weapon proficiencies, armor proficiencies, and feats. In addition, the undead creature gains the victim's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Other abilities, such as class abilities, special attacks, and special qualities, cannot be transferred in this manner.

This process creates a corrupted, twisted version of the original soul with the soul reaper's alignment in the undead creature. Once the ritual is complete, the trapped soul used in the ritual is freed and moves on to the afterlife normally. The reaper gains no special control over undead creatures created in this way unless she already commands them. For purposes of turning or rebuking undead, an undead servitor counts as 1.5 times its actual Hit Dice. Its challenge rating equals its base CR plus 1/4 of the CR of the bound spirit used in the ritual.

#### Spontaneous Divination

You can use your connection to the divine to inquire about mysteries beyond mortal ken.

**Level**: 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a wizard at 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th level.

**Benefit**: You can spontaneously cast any spell you know from the divination school by sacrificing a prepared spell of equal or greater level. For example, if you suddenly have need of the 2nd-level spell locate object, you can sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell (such as mirror image) or any prepared spell of a higher level to cast it on the spot.

#### Wilderness Companion

A [[sorcerer]] or wizard might desire a more durable companion to accompany him on excursions into the wilderness.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Familiar.

**Gain**: Animal companion (as [[druid]]; treat sorcerer or wizard as a druid of half his class level).

#### Wizard of Sun and Moon

You have attuned yourself to the motions of the cosmos. The sun does more than mark off the day as it travels across the sky. It alters the magic you command and the spells available to you. When in the sun's warm embrace, you can cast one set of spells. When you journey into the dark, or when the moon hangs in the sky, you gain access to a second set of spells. This alternative class feature does not give you more spells to cast; it gives you more to prepare and choose from.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit**: You can designate one slot per spell level above 0 as the union of sun and moon. When you prepare your spells, you can prepare two spells for one or more of these slots. Designate one of the two as a spell of the moon and the other as a spell of the sun. You can cast the moon spell only if you are underground or aboveground during the night, and you can cast the sun spell only when you are aboveground during daylight hours. If you cast one of these paired spells, it takes effect normally, but you no longer can use that spell slot to cast the spell from the opposite environment.

For example, Mialee is a 5th-level wizard with Intelligence 16. She selects this class option and prepares her spells for the day as follows. In the list, a superscript M denotes a spell of the moon, which can be cast only underground, or at night aboveground, and a superscript S denotes a spell of the sun, which can be cast only aboveground in daylight.

_3rd_ - DaylightM, displacementS, suggestion;

_2nd_ - Blur, mirror imageM, scorching ray, Tasha's hideous laughterS;

_1st_ - Animate ropeS, hypnotism, magic missile, magic weaponM, sleep;

_0_ - Acid splash, daze, read magic, resistance.

If Mialee casts daylight while underground, she marks that spell plus its environmentally opposite spell of the same level (in this case, displacement) off her list of prepared spells.
