###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the monk.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, sling, and their unarmed strike. Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

**AC Bonus (Ex)**: When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is [[flat-footed]]. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or [[helpless]], when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

**Flurry of Blows (Ex)**: When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.

When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x 1-1/2 or x 1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.

In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.

When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.

**Unarmed Strike**: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.

Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while [[grappling]].

A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.

**Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage**

|Level|Damage (Small Monk)|Damage (Large Monk)|
|---|---|---|
|1st-3rd|1d4|1d8|
|4th-7th|1d6|2d6|
|8th-11th|1d8|2d8|
|12th-15th|1d10|3d6|
|16th-19th|2d6|3d8|
|20th|2d8|4d8|

**Bonus Feat**: At 1st level, a monk may select either [[Improved Grapple]] or [[Stunning Fist]] as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either [[Combat Reflexes]] or [[Deflect Arrows]] as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either [[Improved Disarm]] or [[Improved Trip]] as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A [[helpless]] monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Fast Movement (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

**Still Mind (Ex)**: A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.

**Ki Strike (Su)**: At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.

**Slow Fall (Ex)**: At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.

**Purity of Body (Ex)**: At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.

**Wholeness of Body (Su)**: At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.

**Improved Evasion (Ex)**: At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A [[helpless]] monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

**Diamond Body (Su)**: At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.

**Abundant Step (Su)**: At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).

**Diamond Soul (Ex)**: At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.

**Quivering Palm (Su)**: Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, [[incorporeal]] creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.

**Timeless Body (Ex)**: Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.

**Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)**: A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.

**Empty Body (Su)**: At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.

**Perfect Self**: At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.

###### Ex-Monks

A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.

Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.

#### Aquatic Monk

The unarmed combat traditions of monks are especially useful in an environment that impedes most weapon use. Claws, teeth, and tails are equally deadly underwater as on land, making sahuagin monks especially dangerous. Even those without a native swimming ability can grapple as effectively as aquatic creatures. Monks whose unarmed strikes normally deal bludgeoning damage either arm themselves with appropriate piercing weapons such as the dagger and siangham or take feats such as Toothed Blow to make their underwater attacks more effective. Faster movement allows even an air-breathing monk to move more quickly in the water, while his adroitness at Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble let him move like a squirrel through ships' riggings or keep his feet on the most violently storm-tossed ship.

**Fast Movement (Ex)**: Monks who possess a racial swim speed can choose to apply their fast movement bonus to their swim speed instead of their land speed. The choice must be made when the character gains the class feature and cannot be changed later. This benefit still applies only when the monk is wearing no armor and not carrying a medium or heavy load.

**Water Step (Ex)**: At 4th level, a monk can move with a step so quick and light that he can walk across short distances of water. The maximum distance across which the monk can move is equal to the slow fall distance he otherwise would have (20 feet at 4th level, 30 feet at 6th level, 40 feet at 8th level, and so on up to a maximum of 90 feet at 18th level). He can divide his water-step movement between two consecutive turns, as long as he begins or ends every turn on solid ground. If the monk exceeds his water step distance without setting foot on land (or some other solid footing), or stops moving while still on water, he immediately falls in. He can use water step as part of a move action, including charging or running, and can even make Tumble checks while using water step.

This alternate class feature replaces the standard monk's slow fall class feature.

#### Bane of the Clockwork

Due to your [[Knowledge]] of all things constructed from metal and coils, you are intimately aware of a construct's flaws.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you never gain the slow fall ability, nor your 6th-level bonus feat.

**Benefit**: You can deal critical hit damage against constructs when you attack with unarmed strikes (not with monk special weapons). Constructs are no longer immune to your Stunning Fist or quivering palm attacks.

#### Broken One

These kind and enduring monks dedicated to Ilmater are focused on defending the faithful and temples of the Broken God while acting as agents of punishment against those who would cruelly harm others. They combine the skills of healer and hunter in the service of their deity. They often assist other servants of the Triad when injustices against the innocent have occurred.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Broken One substitution level, a character must have Ilmater as her patron deity, be a member of the Broken Ones, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 6th, or 7th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

Broken One substitution levels have the class skills of the standard monk class plus Heal and Survival.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Broken One Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|

|7th|+5|+5|+5|+5|Locate creature|+4/+4|1d8|+1|+20 ft.|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Broken One substitution levels.

**Lay on Hands (Su)**: At 3rd level, a Broken One can gain the ability to heal wounds with her touch (see the [[Paladin]] class feature). If the character has a Charisma score of 11 or lower, she can heal a number of points of damage each day equal to her monk class level.

This benefit replaces the still mind class feature gained by a standard monk.

**Tenacious Tracker (Su)**: Beginning at 6th level, a Broken One gains the ability to follow the trail of those cruel enough to torture and maim others. She receives Track as a bonus feat. She gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track those with Loviatar as a patron deity.

Furthermore, whenever she physically touches the flesh of one who has been injured within the previous hour by someone who has Loviatar as his patron deity, she receives a clear mental image of that person's true appearance.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard monk at 6th level.

**Locate Creature (Sp)**: Starting at 7th level, a Broken One can use locate creature once per day, but only when attempting to find a creature that has Loviatar as a patron deity. Her caster level is equal to her class level.

This benefit replaces the wholeness of body class feature gained by a standard monk at 7th level.

#### Chaos Monk

Chaos monks practice an art that supplicates chance and anarchy. Their core philosophy preaches that ki is an unbridled energy more potent when untamed. To most, the concept of chaotic monks seems a contradiction, yet those who have witnessed the effects firsthand are loath to deny its power.

The chaos monk is a variant monk. Unless otherwise noted, a chaos monk advances in the same manner as a monk (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of monk or chaos monk, she may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level monk twice.

**Note**: The chaos monk is an optional rule that might seriously alter your game. A DM should be comfortable with the concept before allowing it into his campaign.

**Alignment**: Any chaotic.

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the chaos monk.

**Flailing Strike (Ex)**: Chaos monks practice martial arts with a reckless abandon that shifts drastically from humorously ineffective to frighteningly deadly. At the expense of accuracy, the chaos monk can make a roll (of the die type shown on the chaos monk chart) to determine how many extra attacks she can make (minimum 0). Regardless of the number of attacks made, she suffers an attack penalty on all of them. At 1st level she takes a-2 penalty, at 5th level it decreases to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. Using a flailing strike requires a full-round action and can only be made as part of an unarmed attack or with special monk weapons.

**Erratic Advance (Ex)**: At 5th level, a chaos monk can attempt to daze an opponent with a wild and erratic rush. As part of a charge, a chaos monk can activate this ability, forcing her opponent to make a Will save (DC 10 + chaos monk class level) or become dazed for 1 round. The chaos monk can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day).

**Displacing Stance (Sp)**: Beginning at 7th level, the chaos monk's movements become so wild and unpredictable that she can partially displace herself for a number of rounds per day equal to half her chaos monk class level (these rounds need not be consecutive). This grants the chaos monk a 20% chance that an attacker misses because of the displacing stance. At 12th level the miss chance increases to 50%. This requires a standard action to enter.

**Freedom of Thought (Su)**: The chaos monk's thought process become so anarchic at 11th level that once per day, should she fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect, she may immediately reroll her save (with the same modifiers to the roll). She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.

**Anarchic Self (Su)**: Same as perfect self except the monk gains the chaotic subtype.




#### Decisive Strike

Flurry of blows can be exciting to use - just look at all the attack rolls you can make - but in practice it can lead to a flurry of misses. The decisive strike alternative class feature turns your typical combat maneuver from a whirl of action into a methodical and devastating attack.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain flurry of blows (or any later improvements to that class feature).

**Benefit**: As a full-round action, make one attack with an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon, using your highest base attack bonus but taking a -2 penalty on this attack roll. If the attack hits, it deals double damage (as does any other attack you make before the start of your next turn). If you use this strike to deliver a stunning attack, increase the save DC to resist the stun by 2. This is an extraordinary ability.

At 5th level, the penalty on the attack roll lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears.

At 11th level, you can make two attacks when using this class feature, though no more than one attack can target a single creature. Both attacks use your highest base attack bonus.

#### Dark Moon Disciple

The Monks of the Dark Moon are sorcerer-monks who have dedicated their bodies, minds, and souls to Shar, the Lady of Loss. Because they deal with shadows and the Shadow Weave, they have developed special powers to take advantage of their connection to Shar.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a Dark Moon Disciple substitution level, a character must be a member of the Monks of the Dark Moon sect, have Shar as her patron deity, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 7th, or 12th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

A Dark Moon Disciple has the same selection of class skills as a standard monk does.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the Dark Moon Disciple substitution levels.

**Darkvision (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a Dark Moon Disciple gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

This benefit replaces the still mind class feature that the standard monk gains at 3rd level.

**Shadow Blend (Su)**: In any conditions other than full daylight, a 7th-level Dark Moon Disciple can disappear into the shadows, gaining total concealment. Artificial light does not negate this ability, though a daylight spell does.

This benefit replaces the wholeness of body class feature that the standard monk gains at 7th level.

**Walk the Shadows (Su)**: At 12th level, a Dark Moon Disciple can jump from shadow to shadow. This ability works like the dimension door spell, except that the Dark Moon Disciple can leave and arrive only in areas of shadowy illumination. The caster level equals the character's monk level, and Dark Moon Disciple substitution levels count as monk levels for this purpose. This ability is usable once per day.

This benefit replaces the abundant step class feature that a standard monk gains at 12th level.

  

**Table: Dark Moon Disciple Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|

|12th|+9/+4|+8|+8|+8|Slow fall 60 ft., walk the shadows|+9/+9/+9/+4|2d6|+2|+40 ft.|



#### Draconic Fist

Monks who follow the Way of the Draconic Fist seek to harness their inner ki just as dragons harness their innate magical ability. While you give up versatility in combat, the ability to add energy to your unarmed strikes makes them more potent against a wide range of foes.

**Class**: Monk.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard monk's bonus feat at 1st level.

**Benefit**: When you select this class feature, choose one energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, or fire. As a swift action, you can choose for your next unarmed attack made in this round to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This extra damage improves to 2d6 points at 5th level, and by another 1d6 points every five levels thereafter. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your class level.

#### Eberron Monk

Monks in Eberron are an unusual mixture of contemplative scholars and martial artists. They are called to a life of community apart from the world in which they copy books, preserve the annals of history, and practice the skills they need to defend their faith and fight for the cause of their church.

Monks in Eberron have access to feats representing unique fighting styles derived from their religious traditions. Most monks in Khorvaire follow the religion of the Sovereign Host. Good and neutral monks worship Dol Dorn, the Lord of Strength at Arms. Evil monks are devoted to the Mockery, flaying their own skin in identification with their disfigured patron.

**Bonus Feats**: Good or neutral monks devoted to Dol Dorn may choose Whirling Steel Strike as their bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level, in addition to the normal options at those levels. They must still meet all prerequisites for the feat.

Evil monks devoted to the Mockery may choose Flensing Strike as their bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level, in addition to the normal options at those levels. They must still meet all prerequisites for the feat.

#### Feign Death

A clever villain has many contingencies in place, so that if a plan goes awry, he can beat a hasty retreat. In exchange for some ability to evade damage, he can enter a state that is indistinguishable from death.

**Class**: Monk, ranger, or rogue.

**Level**: 2nd (monk or rogue) or 9th (ranger).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability. If your class would grant you improved evasion at a higher level, you instead gain evasion.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can enter a catatonic state in which you appear to be dead. While feigning death, you cannot see or feel anything, but you retain the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around you.

While under the effect of this ability, you are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate you, such as raise dead or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and true resurrection immediately end your feign death ability.

Spells and other effects that assess your current condition, such as status and deathwatch, indicate that you are dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) can discern that you are actually alive.

You can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though you still require food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.

#### Fighting Styles

In literature and lore, the combat styles and aptitudes of a monk depend greatly on where (or by whom) she was trained. The standard monk, however, presents only a relatively limited variety of options to personalize your monk.

A 1st-level monk (regardless of character level) may select one of the fighting styles described below. By selecting one of these fighting styles, she dictates which bonus feats she gains at 1st, 2nd, and 6th level (when a standard monk normally gains one of two bonus feats). In addition, at 1st level she gets a +2 bonus on checks involving a skill of her selection (in exchange for the freedom of choice she gives up by preselecting her bonus feats). Finally, she gains a bonus ability at 6th level if she has met the listed prerequisites by that time. If the character hasn't yet met the prerequisites, she doesn't gain the bonus ability, even if she meets the prerequisites at some later time.

These fighting styles serve a variety of purposes in a campaign. Each one might symbolize a different monastery, creating a rivalry (friendly or unfriendly) between their students. Perhaps a specific master teaches each style only to a few select students, meaning that a monk must prove herself worthy before pursuing the training. Or maybe each monk simply chooses her own way in life, styling herself after great martial artists of the past.

A monk can abandon her fighting style by selecting a different bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level; however, if she does so, she loses the bonus on skill checks gained at 1st level and never gains the bonus ability of the fighting style (even if she meets the prerequisites).

##### BUDDHIST MONK

Born Siddhartha Guatama in the 6th century BCE, Buddha founded a philosophy on Four Noble Truths: all life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, you can end suffering by overcoming attachment, and a path exists to accomplish this. This path is called the Eightfold Path, a guide for living a virtuous and noble life. Buddha believed that this virtuous life meant a rejection of anger, greed, and jealously, and a constant dedication to good will and self-improvement. But believing these things is not enough to end suffering. Buddha taught you must live the Eightfold Path in thought, action, and desire. In doing so, you can achieve a state of perfection free from desire and suffering - thus becoming enlightened.

Part teacher and part ascetic, a Buddhist monk wanders from villages to serene mountaintops searching for the path of wisdom. Even after attaining enlightenment, some monks still adventure. Known as bodhisattvas in the Buddhist tradition, they attained enlightenment but refused Nirvana so as to teach others how to seek the way. Such teachers are greatly revered.

A Buddhist monk adventures to seek [[Knowledge]] and attain enlightenment. In addition, he adventures to teach others about the path of enlightenment and the inevitable suffering that desire causes. Because the Buddhist monk uses an exalted feat, a monk must be lawful good to take this fighting style.

##### COBRA STRIKE

Monks of the Cobra Strike Academy specialize in agility and defense. Inspired by the lighting-fast strike of the venomous serpent, the Cobra Strike school of martial arts teaches its students to combine mobility with deadly accuracy. By making herself hard to pin down, the Cobra Strike monk forces the enemy to fight on her terms. Although some claim the school was founded twelve centuries ago by a renegade yuan-ti, this is most likely an idle boast. Nevertheless, the masters of the Cobra Strike Academy are legendary for their cruel methods of teaching, a tradition that tends to create hard-hearted students. The masters of the school point to the lack of failed Cobra Strike students in the world as evidence of the efficiency of their methods, but many whisper that it more accurately points to the efficiency of the school in eliminating those who meet with the displeasure of the masters.

##### DENYING STANCE

The Denying Stance seeks to neutralize the opponent's maneuvers, thwarting him at every turn until he becomes so frustrated that he makes a crucial error. An inherently defensive tradition, the Denying Stance was created many years ago by a halfling whose town was controlled by a gang of monks practicing the [[#Overwhelming Attack]] style. It spread like wildfire through the youth of the town, and within three years the cruel overlords had been driven out. Today, Denying Stance is widely practiced by those willing to learn the discipline of a patient defense.

##### FRANCISCAN FRIAR

Founded in 1209 by St. Francis of Assisi, the Franciscans (also known as Grey Friars) practiced charity and led lives as mendicants - that is, they practiced begging as a lifestyle.

Friars maintained an ascetic life organized around vows of poverty, humility, and chastity. The Church expected them to forgo material possessions, live in faith and obedience, and eschew the roles of husbands and fathers in exchange for serving God. Friars differed from monks in the application of their vows to their faith. Whereas monks maintained an ascetic life in monastic seclusion, friars kept no permanent abode. Rather, they begged for a living and performed charity in all acts while traveling the countryside. Peasants recognized the Franciscan Friars as teachers and healers. Living alongside the poor earned them first-hand [[Knowledge]] of the hardships of poverty, which in turn earned them respect among both peasant and noble alike.

Franciscan friars emphasize humility and charity as wandering teachers. They adventure to help the poor and bring relief to those who suffer. Because the Franciscan friar uses an exalted feat, a monk must be lawful good to take this fighting style.

|Prerequisites:|Heal 4 ranks, Survival 4 ranks.|

##### HAND AND FOOT

Students of the Hand and Foot style learn to use their appendages for both offense and defense. This style closely resembles the "traditional" fighting style of the D&D monk, and thus is usually among the most common in any campaign that includes martial artists. The origins of the Hand and Foot technique are lost to the mists of time. Today, it is taught in almost every town large enough to support a school of martial arts, and by solitary masters even in tiny villages. Its simple elegance and effectiveness ensures that it never goes completely out of style. Combining offense and defense, it is among the most well-rounded and balanced fighting styles practiced today.

|Prerequisites:|[[Balance]] 9 ranks, [[Tumble]] 4 ranks.|

##### INVISIBLE EYE

Monks of the Invisible Eye rely on their other senses, particularly hearing, to aid them in combat. To the uninitiated, the style appears essentially defensive, yet a master of the Invisible Eye learns to turn defensive awareness into offensive prowess. The Invisible Eye style was created by an order of monks who voluntarily blinded themselves in order to gain a deeper spiritual awareness. Thankfully to newer students, the modern teachers of the style don't demand such personal sacrifice. In memory of the founders of the style, however, all students spend the entire first year of their training blindfolded. These blindfolds are removed in a ceremony called "The Awakening."

##### KNIGHT HOSPITALLER

The Knights of the Hospital of St. Joseph of Jerusalem, also called the Knights Hospitaller, played a central role in the Christian crusades of the Middle Ages. Founded in the 12th century, the Knights Hospitaller are more commonly associated with the martial image of their rival counterparts, the Knights Templar. Both featured strongly in the Christian campaigns to reclaim Jerusalem and the Holy Land, known in Europe as Outremer: the land beyond the sea.

Originally, the Knights Hospitaller formed a monastic brotherhood dedicated to aiding and protecting pilgrims in the Holy Land. Pilgrims traveling from Europe could count on protection and shelter from the knights. Eventually, with the emergence of the Knights Templar, they morphed into a military organization during the centuries of crusades. Like the Knights Templar, they combined a monastic lifestyle with a knightly one, becoming Medieval Europe's first warrior-priests. Renowned for their courage and martial prowess, they came to lead large armies into battle and served as an elite fighting force in Outremer.

A Knight Hospitaller adventures to protect others or some sacred and honored site.

##### KYOKUSHINKAI KARATE

Kyokushinkai karate, or the "School of Ultimate Truth," is an aggressive Japanese form of martial arts characterized by its highly offensive nature and emphasis on intense conditioning. Kyokushinkai practitioners perform a variety of brutal body hardening exercises during training to callus their bodies in preparation for martial combat. Stylistically, monks who practice kyokushinkai distinguish themselves from other linear martial arts forms in their use of circular movements when executing strikes.

In combat, a student of kyokushinkai engages the enemy purposefully, without hesitation. She makes few extemporaneous movements. The monk launches into an unyielding maelstrom of vicious kicks and punches, seeking to knockout or incapacitate her opponent as quickly as possible.

|Prerequisites:|Concentration 9 ranks, Die Hard.|

##### METERED STYLE

The "metered" fighting style is a discipline that parallels a pattern of rhythmic metered units within a poem. The monk commits a poem to memory and recites it silently during combat.

The smallest metrical unit in poetry is called the "syllable." There are two kinds of syllables: stressed and unstressed. The fighting style mirrors these metrical units in combat. Stressed syllables represent the execution of quick thrusts or strikes. Unstressed syllables indicate executing counters or defensive maneuvers. The metrical unit in poetry known as the "foot" is a group of two or more of these stressed or unstressed syllables. This metrical unit is represented in the fighting style as a more extensive series of move combinations. A foot predominately containing stressed syllables is considered more offensive in nature, while a foot predominately containing unstressed syllables is considered more defensive. The strengths of this style lie within its precision, accuracy, and strict discipline. Its weakness comes in successfully finding and maintaining the metered rhythm of the selected poem.

##### OVERWHELMING ATTACK

A monk trained in the Overwhelming Attack style always presses the advantage, preferring all-out offense over any form of defense. Some monks trained in other styles accuse them of unnecessary brutality, but it's hard to argue with the results. The Overwhelming Attack style is popular among the larger and stronger races, including half-orcs and even the occasional stone giant. It tends to be a very showy style, with many intimidating flourishes mixed in with devastating strikes. Monks who practice this style tend to be enemies of monks of the [[#Denying Stance]], thanks to an old enmity between the two styles.

|Prerequisites:|[[Intimidate]] 4 ranks, [[Perform]] (dance) 4 ranks.|

##### PASSIVE WAY

The Passive Way focuses on making your opponent overreach himself or underestimate your skill. A monk who practices this style typically opens combat in a defensive stance, first taking measure of her opponent before stepping in to take advantage of a momentary opening in the opponent's defenses. This complex style originated among the gith during their long enslavement by the mind flayers. Over the many generations, it has been passed down from teacher to student, usually in private tutelage. Today, the githzerai remain the most common practitioners of the style, although it is believed that some rare githyanki might also teach it to willing students.

##### SHINTO MONK

Shintoism is a Japanese religion dating from around the 4th century BCE. Its beliefs center on nature reverence and worshiping spirits, called kami. Historically, it is a spiritual religion without strong direction from doctrine or divine writings. Rather, Shintoism describes a universal natural force that pervades all living beings. Translated as "the Way from the Gods," it emphasizes the relationship between mortals and the kami. It is a way of thinking and acting that maintains the mortal connection to the natural world.

Shinto monks revere the natural world. They honor its deep beauty and natural order that sustains and protects all people. Kami connect mortals to this natural order, the spiritual realm that pervades all living things. Because it pervades all life, people must act to maintain its balance. Shintoism emphasizes purity of body and heart, rebirth and rejuvenation, and the order of the group over the desires of the individual. Shinto monks regard animals as messengers of the kami and recognize many natural places as sacred, like small forest glades or hidden mountain valleys. Water is often prominent in these sacred places because of its symbolic connection to purity and rebirth.

A Shinto monk adventures to maintain the balance and nature of the kami. He hopes to discover sacred places of nature and to establish a shrine to honor them. Because the Shinto monk uses exalted feats, a monk must be lawful good to take this fighting style.

##### SLEEPING TIGER

The Sleeping Tiger style mixes smooth motions with powerful strikes. It favors a quick, first-strike approach, preferably from a position of ambush. This is among the more physically challenging of the known fighting styles, demanding a combination of strength and agility of those who would master it. For that reason, it is also one of the rarer styles, taught by only a handful of senseis throughout the lands. Even after you find one of these rare teachers, you must then undergo rigorous tests of body and mind to prove your worth, as these teachers don't waste their time with those unfit for the training.

##### UNDYING WAY

Monks of the Undying Way believe in patience above all else. They work to outlast their opponent by means of superior endurance. The Undying Way is popular among dwarves, who claim to have invented the style. Most believe this claim without difficulty, since the style takes advantage of dwarven durability. The masters of the Undying Way are called "Immovables" and are highly respected within dwarven communities. The fact that these masters produce students well-qualified to defend those communities doesn't hurt.

##### WAY OF THE SHACKLED BEAST

All shifters face the beast within. Some cannot keep it chained and unleash its animal fury on their enemies. Others stare into the fierce visage of the beast with a cold gaze and learn to channel their rage into complete martial mastery. This path of self-cultivation is referred to as the Way of the Shackled Beast and many shifters train in its secrets, learning to hone their fighting skills through self-control and a unique system of martial arts focused on their shapechanger physiology and spiritual path.

The Way of the Shackled Beast is a new fighting style available to shifter monks. Shifter monks who practice the Way of the Shackled Beast utilize the ferocity and power inherent in their race.

##### WING CHUN KUEN

Wing chun kuen (sometimes referred to as wing chun gung fu), or "sticking hands," is an intricate martial art best described as a southern Chinese boxing style. Students develop their hand speed, counter-punching, and trapping abilities on wooden dummies and through blindfolded exercises. Practitioners utilize a variety of simple, deceptively effective techniques (such as the one-inch punch popularized by Bruce Lee) to incapacitate their opponents.

In combat, a monk who practices wing chun kuen advocates engaging opponents at close range, then adapting to the attacks of an opponent. Perfectly timed counterstrikes, rapid straight punches, and precise footwork all define the art.

##### WUSHU

Translated as "Chinese Martial Arts" or "the Art of War," wushu combines hard kicks and strikes with softer, more indirect methods of self-defense in a highly acrobatic style. The art places emphasis on aesthetics, encouraging fluidity and beauty in the execution of techniques. Wushu practitioners are also renown for their athletic ability, speed, and balance. Sometimes mislabeled as kung fu, cinema has popularized this style of martial arts, most notably in the films of Jet Li. Monks of this style can easily adapt their technique to a given opponent or situation.

In combat, a monk who studies wushu engages his opponent with tactical precision. The wushu stylist uses hit and run tactics to frustrate her adversary and weaken her opponent's resolve. Wushu practitioners are characterized by their uncanny mobility. They can blindside their opponents with series of highly acrobatic aerial maneuvers and disorienting attacks.

**Bonus Feats**: _1st level_ - Improved Grapple or Point-Blank Shot.

_2nd level_ - Stunning Fist or Deflect Arrows.

_6th level_ - Improved Trip or Rapid Fire.



#### Halfling Monk

Monk seems a counterintuitive selection for the halfling at first glance, since the halfling incurs significant penalties to her ability to deal damage in melee because of her Small size. A halfling monk, however, can learn to focus on mobility and eventually even neutralize some of the larger creatures' advantages over her.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a halfling monk substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 7th level of monk.

A halfling monk who selects any racial substitution level for her monk class can freely multiclass between the monk and rogue classes.

##### Class Skills

Halfling monk substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard monk class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the halfling monk's racial substitution levels.

**Skirmish (Ex)**: A halfling monk relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. At 1st level, a halfling monk deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks made with unarmed strikes or special monk weapons (that is, the weapons a normal monk can use as part of a flurry of blows), and only on attacks taken during the monk's turn. This bonus increases to an extra 2d6 points of damage at 11th level.

The extra damage only applies against a living creature with a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The monk must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Halfling monks can apply this additional damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet.

At 5th level, the monk also gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the monk has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves to +2 at 15th level.

The monk loses this ability when wearing armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk's flurry of blows ability. A halfling monk who selects this substitution level gains no benefit from any feature that improves or augments the flurry of blows class feature (such as the 11th-level monk's greater flurry ability).

**Bonus Feat**: At 2nd level, a halfling monk gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk's bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

**Size Matters Not (Ex)**: At 7th level, a halfling monk learns to neutralize some of the natural advantage gained by particularly large opponents.

A halfling monk with Improved Grapple gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents at least two size categories larger than herself. This is in addition to the +4 bonus granted by the feat.

A halfling monk with Stunning Fist gains a +4 bonus on her stunning fist DC for stunning attacks made against opponents at least two size categories larger than herself.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk's wholeness of body ability gained at 7th level.

#### Hin Disciple

Halfling monks of the Hin Fist are trained to use a foe's size against it. Their fighting style emphasizes bringing down larger foes and evading their attacks.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take a Hin Disciple substitution level, a character must be a halfling member of the Hin Fist order, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 1st, 6th, or 9th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

A Hin Disciple has the same selection of class skills as a standard monk does.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Hin Disciple Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+2|+2|+2|Bonus feat, flurry of blows, unarmed strike|-2/-2|1d4|+0|+0 ft.|
|6th|+4|+5|+5|+5|Blur of motion, slow fall 30 ft.|+3/+3|1d6|+1|+20 ft.|
|9th|+6/+1|+6|+6|+6|The harder they fall|+6/+6/+1|1d8|+1|+30 ft.|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the Hin Disciple substitution levels.

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, a Hin Disciple monk may choose either Underfoot Combat or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, instead of Improved Grapple. At 2nd level, he can choose between Improved Trip and Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat. He need not meet the prerequisites for these feats. The Hin Disciple does not gain a bonus feat at 6th level.

_Underfoot Combat_: You can move into or through a space occupied by a Large or larger foe without provoking attacks of opportunity. While you are in a square occupied by a Large or larger creature, you gain a +4 cover bonus to AC against all attacks, even those made by the creature whose space you occupy.

**Blur of Motion (Ex)**: A 6th-level Hin Disciple with at least 5 ranks in Tumble can use the total defense option and still make a single attack in the same round. Blur of motion is a full-round action that can be used only against Large or larger foes.

This benefit replaces the choice of bonus feats that a standard monk gains at 6th level.

**The Harder They Fall (Ex)**: A 9th-level Hin Disciple monk who has taken Improved Trip may grant allies some of that feat's benefit. When the Hin Disciple trips a foe whose square he occupies, every ally within melee reach of the downed foe may immediately make a single attack at its full attack bonus on that opponent. Each ally also gains the +4 bonus on attack rolls for attacking a prone foe. This attack is made on the Hin Disciple's turn and does not count against the number of attacks that the allies can make on their own turns. No combination of feats or abilities can grant a second attack by any ally during the Hin Disciple's turn.

This benefit replaces the standard monk's improved evasion ability. Furthermore, the Hin Disciplemay never gain improved evasion from any class in the future.

#### Holy Monk

A monk who is particularly devoted to her religious beliefs gains divine powers in trade for some of her other talents.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Bonus feats at 1st and 6th level.

**Gain**: Aura of courage, smite evil, turn undead (all as paladin).

**Multiclass Options**: This monk can multiclass between paladin and monk with no penalty. Her monk class levels stack with paladin levels for determining her daily uses of smite evil and her effective turning level.

#### Holy Strike

Your fists and monk weapons gain the power of your beliefs and can strike your opponents for extra damage.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the ki strike (magic) class feature.

**Benefit**: When you hit an evil creature with your unarmed strike attack or with a monk melee weapon, your attack is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and deals an extra ld6 points of damage. Holy strike is a supernatural ability.

**Special**: Evil monks can select this ability, but their attacks are considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

#### Hunter Monk

After mastering the basic talents of martial arts, some monks are selected to trade life in the monastery for a life hunting the enemies of his order.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Bonus feat (1st level), slow fall.

**Gain**: Favored enemy (as ranger), swift tracker (as ranger), Survival as class skill.

**Multiclass Options**: This monk can multiclass between ranger and monk with no penalty. Her monk class levels stack with ranger levels for determining when she gains new favored enemies.

#### Illuminated Monk

Some monks find focus in meditation, cloistering themselves away to hone their intellects as well as their physiques and wits. Illuminated monks often serve as archive-keepers in libraries and teachers in schools and universities. Just as the sun personifies reason and wisdom, the illuminated monk studies all varieties of lore and passes on his [[Knowledge]] to others.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take an illuminated monk substitution level, a character must come from a sun-centered society or worship a sun deity, and must be about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 6th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

Illuminated monk substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard monk class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times that number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Illuminated Monk Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+2|+2|+2|Bonus feat, flurry of blows, unarmed strike|-2/-2|1d6|+0|+0 ft.|
|2nd|+1|+3|+3|+3|Bonus feat, evasion|-1/-1|1d6|+0|+0 ft.|
|6th|+4|+5|+5|+5|Meditative focus, slow fall 30 ft.|+3/+3|1d8|+1|+20 ft.|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the illuminated monk's substitution levels.

**Bonus Feat**: At 1st level, an illuminated monk may select Skill Focus as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, an illuminated monk may select either Investigator or Negotiator as a bonus feat.

These substitution features replace the standard monk's bonus feats gained at 1st and 2nd level.

**Meditative Focus (Ex)**: At 6th level, the illuminated monk can use meditation to focus his mind on the details of a particular skill. Every day at dawn, the illuminated monk may spend 15 minutes in quiet contemplation, meditating on the specifics of a certain skill. He cannot be interrupted during his meditation or he must start the process over again. Until the following dawn, he receives the skill mastery ability (see the [[rogue]] class feature) for that skill. Each morning, the illuminated monk may change the skill mastery he receives with meditative focus.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk's bonus feat gained at 6th level.

#### Invisible Fist

Monks who follow the Path of the Invisible Fist learn to harness their ki to conceal themselves from detection. With further training, these monks learn to blink between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. To gain this versatility, they sacrifice their ability to escape unscathed from area effects.

**Class**: Monk.

**Level**: 2nd.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability, nor do you gain improved evasion at 9th level.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can become invisible for 1 round. You must wait 3 rounds before you can use this ability again.

At 9th level, as an immediate action, you can use blink, as the spell, for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). You must wait 3 rounds before you can use this ability again.

Invisible fist is a supernatural ability.

#### Kalashtar Monk

The kalashtar monk uses his natural psionic ability to augment his combat prowess, allowing him to perform tasks beyond even a monk's impressive abilities. Though they do not learn specific psionic powers, kalashtar monks channel their psionic talent in other ways.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a kalashtar monk substitution level, a character must be a kalashtar about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 7th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

Kalashtar monk substitution levels have the class skills of the standard monk class plus Autohypnosis and [[Knowledge]] (psionics).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Kalashtar Monk Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+0|+2|+2|+2|Bonus feat, psychic insight, unarmed strike|—|1d6|+0|+0 ft.|
|2nd|+1|+3|+3|+3|Bonus feat, evasion|—|1d6|+0|+0 ft.|
|7th|+5|+5|+5|+5|Wholeness of body|—|1d8|+1|+20 ft.|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the kalashtar monk's racial substitution levels. The kalashtar monk's unarmed damage, AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus all progress as for a standard monk.

**Psychic Insight (Su)**: Once per round, a kalashtar monk can spend 1 power point as a swift action to gain a +1 insight bonus on the next grapple check or stunning fist attack roll he makes. The bonus lasts for up to 1 round and is lost if not used in that time.

As the monk gains levels, he can spend additional power points as part of the swift action (up to 2 power points at 5th level, and up to 3 at 11th level), with each power point spent increasing the insight bonus by 1.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk's flurry of blows ability. If the monk later gains an ability that improves his flurry of blows, that ability has no effect.

**Bonus Feat**: At 2nd level, a kalashtar monk can select any psionic feat as a bonus feat (provided he meets the normal prerequisites).

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk's bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

**Wholeness of Body (Su)**: A kalashtar monk of 7th level or higher can psionically augment the standard monk's wholeness of body ability by spending 1 or more power points as part of the action used to activate it. Each power point spent heals an additional 1 point of damage.

#### Martial Monk

Some monks train as soldiers rather than as ascetic mystic warriors. These martial artists have a greater range of combat talents, but have less time to practice other skills.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: -1 skill point per level (and -4 skill points at 1st level); no [[Knowledge]] skills as class skills.

**Gain**: Fighter bonus feat list to choose monk bonus feats (at 1st, 2nd, and 6th level); Intimidate is class skill.

**Multiclass Options**: This monk can multiclass between fighter and monk with no penalty.



#### Phoenix Disciple

The Disciples of the Phoenix are unusual lawful good Kossuthan monks. They are extremely disciplined and take some of their beliefs to painful extremes. Obsessed with the power of fire to purify, they have developed strange monk abilities based on that concept.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Phoenix Disciple substitution level, a character must be lawful good, have Kossuth as his patron deity, be a member of the Disciples of the Phoenix order, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 12th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

Phoenix Disciple substitution levels have the class skills of the standard monk class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Phoenix Disciple substitution levels.

**Purifying Flame (Su)**: A Phoenix Disciple can transform his ki into purifying fire. Once per round, a Phoenix Disciple can add 1d6 points of fire damage to any unarmed strike. The decision to use this ability must be made before the attack is rolled; if the attack misses, the power is wasted. A Phoenix Disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his monk level.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 1st-level monk.

**Resistance to Fire (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a Phoenix Disciple develops a minor tolerance for fire. He gains resistance to fire 5.

This benefit replaces the still mind class feature gained by a standard monk at 3rd level.

**Fire Stride (Sp)**: At 12th level, a Phoenix Disciple gains the ability to use a fire stride effect once per day, using his monk level as his caster level.

This benefit replaces the abundant step class feature gained by a standard monk at 12th level.

  

**Table: Phoenix Disciple Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

|3rd|+2|+3|+3|+3|Resistance to fire|+0/+0|1d6|+0|+10 ft.|
|12th|+9/+4|+8|+8|+8|Fire stride, slow fall 60 ft.|+9/+9/+9/+4|2d6|+2|+40 ft.|

  

#### Prayerful Meditation

Your religious convictions protect you from the spells and magical abilities of those who oppose your beliefs.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the still mind class feature.

**Benefit**: Your adherence to a religious path has developed in you a resistance to antithetical magic. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from chaotic-aligned creatures and creatures with a moral (good/evil) alignment component opposite to yours. This is a supernatural ability.



#### Planar Monk

Monks who travel the planes do so for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from seeking to restore an ancient artifact to their temple to a much more general quest for enlightenment. The magnificent diversity of the planes lead many monks to adventure, and few return to quiet monastic study without having spent at least some time exploring. Living out a classic paradox, most find both more and less than they anticipate.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a monk planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 5th, 13th, or 16th level of monk.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Monk planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard monk class plus [[Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the monk's planar substitution levels.

**Resistant Body (Ex)**: At 5th level, a planar monk successfully hardens her body against one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), gaining resistance 5.

This benefit replaces the purity of body class feature gained by a standard monk at 5th level.

**Axiomatic Soul (Ex)**: At 13th level, a planar monk gains spell resistance equal to her class level +15. This spell resistance applies only to effects generated by chaotic outsiders.

This benefit replaces the diamond soul class feature gained by a standard monk at 13th level.

**Ki Strike (Su)**: At 16th level, a planar monk's unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

This benefit replaces the ki strike (adamantine) class feature gained by a standard monk at 16th level.

  

**Table: Monk Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|

|13nd|+9/+4|+8|+8|+8|Axiomatic soul|+9/+9/+9/+4|2d6|+2|+40 ft.|
|16th|+12/+7/+2|+10|+10|+10|Ki strike (cold iron), slow fall (80 ft.)|+12/+12/+12/+7/+2|2d8|+3|+50 ft.|

  

#### Raging Monk

A monk who learns to master her inner fury is capable of channeling this into great physical power, although at the cost of some of her physical and mental grace.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Flurry of blows, still mind, greater flurry, quivering palm.

**Gain**: Rage. greater rage, mighty rage (all as barbarian).

**Ex-Monk Options**: If this character becomes chaotic and begins gaining levels of barbarian, she retains her monk rage abilities and can add her monk class levels to her barbarian levels to determine the number of times per day she can rage (as well as when she gains greater rage and mighty rage).

#### Sacred Strike

Sacred strike grants you greater flexibility in which creatures you can affect with your ki strike ability, allowing you to more effectively combat those who invoke your deity's wrath.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain ki strike (magic) (or any later improvements to that class feature) or improved evasion.

**Benefits**: When you attack with your deity's favored weapon you may make a special smite attack against the sworn enemies of your faith a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). Add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and you deal 1 extra point of damage per monk level. If you smite a creature that is not an enemy of your faith, the smite has no effect and that use of the ability is spent.

|Deity|Sworn Enemies|
|---|---|
|Heironeous|All evil creatures|
|Hextor|All good creatures|
|Moradin|All evil creatures|
|St. Cuthbert|All chaotic creatures|
|Wee Jas|All chaotic creatures|
|Yondalla|All evil creatures|

Your sacred strike improves with your class level. At 10th level, your sacred strike deals damage as above and stuns an enemy of your faith for 1 round (Will save negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your monk level + your Wisdom modifier). At 16th level, your sacred strike can stuns an enemy of your faith for 1 round (Will save negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your monk level + your Wisdom modifier) and blinds that enemy for 1d8 rounds (no save for blindness effect). Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the stunning and blinding effects.

#### Sidewinder Monk

The Order of the Sidewinder, a small and controversial order, is among the world's strangest and least understood monastic organizations. Called sidewinder monks, those of this order imitate the attitudes of the deceptive snake from which they take their name.

The sidewinder monk is a variant monk. Unless otherwise noted, a sidewinder monk advances in the same manner as a monk (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of monk or sidewinder monk, she may not later take levels in the other class.

**Table: The Sidewinder Monk**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Flurry of Blows  <br>Attack Bonus|Unarmed  <br>Damage|AC  <br>Bonus|Unarmored  <br>Speed Bonus|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the sidewinder monk.

**Bonus Feat**: At 1st level, a sidewinder monk may select either Persuasive or Stealthy as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may take either Improved Feint or Mobility. At 6th level, she may choose either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip. She need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

**Silver Tongue (Ex)**: From 2nd level, the sidewinder monk masters deception. Using false promises, empty threats, and personal magnetism, the monk gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks. This bonus increases by +1 at 4th level and every even numbered level thereafter.

**Earthbound (Ex)**: The sidewinder monk develops an innate connection with the earth, granting her a +4 competence bonus on opposed Strength checks made to resist bull rush or overrun attempts.

**Sneak Attack (Ex)**: At 3rd level the sidewinder monk gains the ability to sneak attack, as the rogue ability. Her bonus damage increases every three levels thereafter (+2d6 at 6th, +3d6 at 9th, and so on).

**Fangs (Su)**: A 4th-level sidewinder monk can grow fangs and gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage (1d3 for Small monks). She can grow her fangs once per day at 4th level and one additional time for every four levels thereafter. The fangs remain for a number of rounds equal to 1 + Constitution bonus (minimum one). This attack is made at her highest attack bonus. If made with a flurry of blows, the bite attack and all other flurry attacks suffer a -2 penalty.

At 15th level the sidewinder monk may, once per day, use her bite attack to instantly slay a living creature. The target of this attack must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 sidewinder monk levels + Constitution modifier) or die. This is a poison attack.

**Intimidating Stance (Ex)**: By imitating the attitude and demeanor of a sidewinder, the sidewinder monk gains a +4 competence bonus on all Intimidate checks. This bonus improves to +6 when using her fang ability.

#### Soulwarp Strike

The traditional monk seeks balance in body, mind, and soul, and through this equilibrium gains various combat talents. A monk who learns the secret of the soulwarp strike masters an arcane talent of necromancy that infects her enemy's ki, producing an effect akin to terrible sickness.

**Class**: Monk.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: [[Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain the monk bonus feat normally acquired at 1st level.

**Benefit**: You know how to channel necromantic energy into your unarmed strikes. You must declare that you are using this ability before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). In addition to dealing its normal damage, your unarmed strike renders any living creature nauseated for 1 round, or sickened for 1 round if it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your monk level, and no more than once per round. Creatures immune to necromancy effects (such as constructs) are unaffected by this ability.



#### Skarn Monk

A skarn monk takes his race's dedication to "perfection of form" to great extremes, tuning his body, mind, and soul to extraordinary purity. As part of this perfection, he learns to channel incarnum to achieve various effects and also gains the ability to use his arm spines with tremendous effectiveness.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a skarn monk substitution level, a character must be a skarn about to take his 1st, 5th, or 10th level of monk.

##### Class Skills

Skarn monk substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard monk class, plus Intimidate.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the skarn monk racial substitution levels.

**Spine Strike (Ex)**: For all purposes related to monk class features, a skarn monk can treat his arm-spine attack as if it were an unarmed strike. This includes using it as part of a flurry of blows, ki strike, and the increased damage dealt by arm spines as the skarn monk gains levels (1d8 at 4th level, 1d10 at 8th level, and so forth).

This benefit replaces a standard monk's unarmed strike class feature gained at 1st level.

**Defensive Insight (Su)**: As a skarn monk becomes more in tune with the soul energy f lowing through his body, he learns to rely on this insight to aid his defense. Beginning at 5th level, a skarn monk gains a +1 insight bonus to AC for every point of essentia invested in this class feature. Insight bonuses to AC apply at all times, even against touch attacks or when a skarn monk is flat-footed, immobilized, or helpless. Wearing armor, carrying a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load has no effect on this AC bonus.

A skarn monk gains 1 point of essentia at 5th level.

This benefit replaces a standard monk's AC bonus gained at 5th level and improved every five levels thereafter. (A skarn monk still adds his Wisdom bonus to his AC.)

**Shape Soulmeld (Su)**: A skarn monk's perfection of body and soul is so strong that at 10th level, he gains the ability to shape a single soulmeld (as long as he has a Constitution score of 11 or higher). A skarn monk can shape this soulmeld each day, following the normal rules for meldshaping. This soulmeld must be chosen from the soulborn class list. A skarn monk's meldshaper level is equal to one-half his monk level. The save DC (if any) for the soulmeld is equal to 10 + invested essentia + his Wis modifier.

This benefit replaces a standard monk's ki strike (lawful) class feature gained at 10th level.

**Chakra Bind (Arms)**: A skarn monk can bind a soulmeld (see above) to his arms chakra, following the normal rules for chakra binds.

#### Spell Reflection

Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.

**Class**: Monk, ranger, rogue, or scout.

**Level**: 2nd (monk or rogue), 5th (scout), or 9th (ranger).

**Special Requirement**: [[Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)

**Benefit**: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability.

For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a scorching ray, you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the scorching ray deals its normal damage to the wizard.

This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren't subject to this reflection.

If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as scorching ray cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard's scorching ray spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).

#### Standing Jump

While most monks gain a fluid grace that allows them to move with astounding speed, you have learned how to focus your energy and expel it in one quick burst.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, your fast movement ability is reduced. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to speed at 12th level and another +10-foot bonus at 18th level.

**Benefit**: At 3rd level, you can make a standing long jump with ease. The check DCs for your long jumps do not require a 20-foot running start and do not double when you leap from a standing position. At 6th level, you apply this skill to high jumps. The check DCs for your high jumps do not double when you leap from a standing position. You lose these benefits when wearing armor (even light armor) or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

#### Steadfast Monk

A monk might choose to give up some of her mobility in exchange for the ability to withstand attacks.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Enhancement bonus to unarmored speed, bonus to Armor Class when unarmored (retain Wisdom bonus to AC when unarmored).

**Gain**: Damage reduction (as [[Barbarian]]).

#### Unwavering Dedication

Sacred enforcers are sometimes called upon to learn special techniques and abilities not taught to monks. You can ignore the multiclass restrictions of the monk for some classes.

**Level**: 3rd.

**Replaces**: If you select this Class feature, you do not gain still mind.

**Benefits**: Taking levels in cleric, paladin, or blackguard (depending on your alignment) does not prevent you from taking monk levels. If you take levels in any other class, you lose your ability to progress as a monk as usual. Taking levels in monk does not prevent you from advancing as a paladin.

#### Vigilant Monk

A monk who can open her mind to a greater awareness gains the talent to identify her enemies more easily, but she gives up some of her inner peace.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Bonus feats at 2nd and 6th level, still mind.

**Gain**: Detect chaos (as paladin's detect evil ability), uncanny dodge (as barbarian), improved uncanny dodge (as barbarian).

#### Wall Walker

You have the uncanny ability to travel along vertical surfaces for a short time.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the slow fall ability.

**Benefit**: Beginning at 4th level, as a move action, you can run up or down a vertical surface a total distance of 20 feet without making a Climb check. You add 10 feet to this distance at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, up to your maximum speed. You can use this ability only once per round (so you can't make a double move up or down a wall).

If you do not reach the top of the vertical surface or find a suitable hand- or foothold, you must make a Climb check appropriate to the surface. If you succeed on the check, you can use this ability again in the next round. Otherwise, you fall or make no progress, as determined by the check result.

You can't use this ability to traverse a ceiling or overhang.

#### Weapon Proficiencies

The standard monk uses a set of weapons most commonly seen in traditional Okinawan and Japanese martial arts systems. The sai and kama, in particular, are often associated with the fighting methods of those island nations, while weapons like the quarterstaff are more widely used and practiced throughout the world. Many other fighting styles and cultures exist worldwide, and not all monks must practice the same martial arts. If your monk wants something a little different, try one of these real-world fighting styles from Southeast Asia.

##### THE GHURKA

Since the early 1800s, members of this Nepalese tribe have served as special forces for the British military. Noted for their stealth and ferocity in battle, the Ghurka earned great fame for themselves and their weapon of choice, the kukri. The kukri is a common tool for these people, and many children as young as five years old receive one. As the child grows, he develops great skill with the kukri, since it is used for everything from cutting wood to skinning game.

In a D&D campaign, the Ghurka (or a similar tribe) might be special agents of a great empire, or just a small but deadly tribe hidden in a faraway mountain jungle. Many of the tribesmen could be rangers or barbarians, but monks represent the true masters of their fighting art.

A Ghurka monk loses proficiency in the kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, and siangham and gains proficiency in the kukri, short sword (some kukri are quite large), and short bow. The Ghurka monk uses the kukri, short sword, and club as special monk weapons.

##### ARNIS, KALI, ESCRIMA

These three terms refer to a wide variety of Filipino martial arts systems. Each has a long and unique history, and detailing each art is far beyond the scope of this article. They do share certain common traits and training methods that can be applied to the monk class.

Filipino martial culture makes extensive use of the knife, and some Filipinos carry a blade from an early age. Classical Filipino martial arts use blades as short as daggers or as large as longswords. During training, short sticks are often used as a substitute for blades and many Filipino masters are as dangerous with a stick as they are with a blade. Many of these styles teach the use of these weapons in pairs, a tactic than can be represented with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat in D&D.

Monks trained in Filipino martial arts lose proficiency in the kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, and siangham but gain proficiency in the short sword, longsword, and whip. Monks using this style count the club, dagger, quarterstaff, and short sword as their special monk weapons.

##### KRABI-KRABONG

Movies and kickboxing competitions have helped to popularize the art of Muay Thai, but Krabi-Krabong - a Thai weapons-based art - is less well known. The art is considered by some to be a predecessor of Muay Thai, and it utilizes many of the same powerful kicks, elbow, and knee strikes that Muay Thai is famous for. Thai culture is strongly Buddhist, and Krabi-Krabong incorporates many Buddhist rituals and beliefs into its training.

Krabi-Krabong teaches the use of five weapons and three types of shields. The weapons include the daab, a heavy curved sword often used in pairs (a technique referred to as Daab Song Muun); the krabi, a short saber; the krabong, a long bamboo staff; the mae sun sowks, a tonfa-like weapon also used in pairs; and the ngao (spear). The shields consist of the dung (long shield), kaen (medium shield), and loh (round shield). Techniques are often practiced with live blades, so students must learn control as well as power and timing.

In place of the kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, and siangham, monks trained in Krabi-Krabong learn the short sword, spear, and short spear and treat all those weapons as special monk weapons (as well as the club and quarterstaff). They also gain proficiency with all shields except tower shields, although they do not gain additional armor proficiency.

#### Wholeness of Others

Like their cleric brethren, sacred enforcers frequently look beyond themselves to the safety and well-being of others. Although they tend to work alone, some sacred enforcers like to travel with companions. These sacred enforcers learn the secret ki techniques necessary to heal the wounds of others.

**Level**: 7th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wholeness of body.

**Benefits**: You can heal the wounds of others with a touch. You can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice your current class level each day, and you can spread this healing out among several uses and recipients. Each use is a standard action. You may not heal yourself with this ability.

#### Wild Monk

The wild monk attains perfection by embracing the natural order. She learns from the ebb and flow of the seasons and the living land. She imitates the ways of animals - how they move, how they fight, and how they find their places in the world. As the wild monk grows in power, she assumes a number of druidic abilities.

Wild monks do not congregate in monasteries as do normal monks. Instead, they gather in small communities, often in sacred or otherwise special natural locales. If they share territory with druids, wild monk communities usually stay on good terms with them. Like rangers. many wild monks serve with druids and aid them in defending nature. Although they often worship gods of nature or nature itself, some wild monks also revere tribal deities or the lawful deities of normal monks.

The wild monk is a variant monk. Unless otherwise noted, a wild monk advances in the same manner as a monk (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of monk or wild monk, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level monk twice.

**Alignment**: Wild monks must adhere to the discipline of the natural order. They may only be lawful neutral.

##### Class Skills

The wild monk's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), [[Climb]] (Str), [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Hide]] (Dex), [[Jump]] (Str), [[Knowledge]] (nature) (Int), [[Listen]] (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), [[Profession]] (Wis), [[Spot]] (Wis), [[Survival]] (Wis), [[Swim]] (Str), and Tumble (Dex).

##### Class Features

The wild monk trades several monk class features for druid abilities as noted on the level progression table. The wild monk may freely multiclass with the druid class. If the character chooses any other multiclass option, she may not gain any more wild monk levels.

**Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, the wild monk gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

**Wild Shape (Su)**: At 6th level, the wild monk gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. This ability works exactly as the druid ability of the same name. The wild monk can use this ability more times per day at 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th level, as noted on the wild monk advancement table. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 12th level, a Tiny animal at 15th level, and a Huge animal at 16th level. At 19th level, the wild monk becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental once per day.

If a character has levels in both wild monk and druid, the wild shape abilities of each class act independently of the other. Thus, an 11th-level druid/9th-level wild monk could wild shape four times per day as a druid and take the form of any Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large animal, and she could wild shape twice per day as a wild monk and take the form of any Small or Medium animal.
