### FIGHTER

<br><br>The questing knight, the conquering overlord, the king's champion, the elite foot soldier, the hardened mercenary, and the bandit king - all are fighters. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or gutsy adventurers. Some are among the land's best souls, willing to face death for the greater good. Others are among the worst, with no qualms about killing for private gain, or even for sport. Fighters who are not actively adventuring may be soldiers, guards, bodyguards, champions, or criminal enforcers. An adventuring fighter might call himself a warrior, a mercenary, a thug, or simply an adventurer.<br><br>Most fighters see adventures, raids, and dangerous missions as their job. Some have patrons who pay them regularly. Others prefer to live like prospectors, taking great risks in hopes of the big haul. Some fighters are more civic-minded and use their combat skills to protect endangered people who cannot defend themselves. Whatever their initial motivations, however, fighters often wind up living for the thrill of combat and adventure.<br><br>Of all classes, fighters have the best all-around fighting capabilities (hence the name). Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors. In addition to general fighting prowess, each fighter develops particular specialties of his own. A given fighter may be especially capable with certain weapons, another might be trained to execute specific fancy maneuvers. As fighters gain experience, they get more opportunities to develop their fighting skills. Thanks to their focus on combat maneuvers, they can master the most difficult ones relatively quickly.<br><br>Fighters may be of any alignment. Good fighters are often crusading types who seek out and fight evil. Lawful fighters may be champions who protect the land and its people. Chaotic fighters may be wandering mercenaries. Evil fighters tend to be bullies and petty villains who simply take what they want by brute force.<br><br>Fighters often worship Heironeous (god of valor), Kord (god of strength), St. Cuthbert (god of retribution), Hextor (god of tyranny), or Erythnul (god of slaughter). A fighter may style himself as a crusader in the service of his god, or he may just want someone to pray to before putting his life on the line yet another time.<br><br>Fighters come to their profession in many ways. Most have had formal training in a noble's army or at least in the local militia. Some have trained in formal academies. Others are self-taught - unpolished but well tested. A fighter may have taken up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on the farm, or he may be following a proud family tradition. Fighters share no special identity. They do not see themselves as a group or brotherhood. Those who hail from a particular academy, mercenary company, or lord's regiment, however, share a certain camaraderie.<br><br>Human fighters are usually veterans of some military service, typically from more mundane parents. Dwarf fighters are commonly former members of the well-trained strike teams that protect the underground dwarven kingdoms. They are typically members of warrior families that can trace their lineages back for millennia, and they may have rivalries or alliances with other dwarf fighters of a different lineage. Elf fighters are typically skilled with the longsword. They are proud of their ability at swordplay and eager to demonstrate or test it.<br><br>Half-orc fighters are often selftaught outcasts who have achieved enough skill to earn recognition and something akin to respect. Gnome and halfling fighters usually stay in their own communities as part of the area militia rather than adventuring. Half-elves are rarely fighters, but they may take up swordplay in honor of the elven tradition.<br><br>Among the brutal humanoids, few can manage the discipline it takes to be a true fighter. The militaristic hobgoblins, however, produce quite a number of strong and skilled fighters.<br><br>The fighter excels in a straight fight, but he relies on others for magical support, healing, and scouting. On a team, it is his job to man the front lines, protect the other party members, and bring the tough opponents down. Fighters might not understand the arcane ways of wizards or share the faith of clerics, but they recognize the value of teamwork.<br><br>In most adventuring parties, the fighter serves as a melee combatant, charging into the fray while his comrades support him with spells, ranged attacks, and other effects. Fighters who favor ranged combat can prove very deadly, though without other melee support, they can find themselves in front-line combat more often than they might prefer.|

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the fighter.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. A fighter is not limited to the [[list of fighter bonus feats]] when choosing these feats.

#### Aligned Strike

As a holy warrior, you can channel your faith into your attacks.

**Level**: 4th or any even-numbered higher level.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces one of your fighter bonus feats.

**Benefit**: As a free action, you can orient your weapon along one alignment component that you possess. For example, if you are chaotic good, you can make your weapon either chaotic- or good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This effect lasts until you choose to end it or change it (as a free action) to the other alignment component, or until you no longer wield the weapon.

Ammunition or a thrown weapon affected by this ability remains aligned until it either strikes a target or misses. Aligned strike is a supernatural ability.

#### Armor of God

Your belief protects you from attacks.

**Level**: 8th or any even-numbered higher level.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces one of your fighter bonus feats.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can reduce your base Will save to +0 and gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the amount of the reduction. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Armor of god is a supernatural ability.

#### Armored Mage

Rare is the fighter who hasn't envied the wizard's bag of magical tricks. Although even the most basic arcane spell remains beyond a fighter's abilities, those who aspire to such talents can, with practice, learn to cast simple arcane spells while wearing light armor. On its own, this alternative feature grants little benefit to a single-classed fighter; only in conjunction with one or more levels of sorcerer, wizard, or a similar arcane spellcasting class does this ability come into play.

**Class**: Fighter.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: [[Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You lose proficiency with medium armor and heavy armor.

**Benefit**: Choose one arcane spellcasting class, such as sorcerer. You can avoid any chance of arcane spell failure for spells gained from this class as long as you restrict yourself to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to any other form of armor or shields, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes.

This benefit applies only to spells of a level equal to or lower than your fighter class level + 1.

#### Armored Savant

You have a mystic connection to your armor.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 1st level.

**Benefit**: At 1st level, you show an inborn mastery for wearing bulky armors in such a way that they do not hinder you. You ignore the weight of your armor for the purpose of calculating encumbrance and your armor slows you as if it were one category lighter than it is (so medium armor does not slow you and heavy armor slows you as if it were medium armor). In addition, the maximum Dexterity bonus for any armor you wear improves by +1 and the arcane spell failure chance of any armor you wear is half normal. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Bodyguard

While anyone suspicious, alert, and tough enough can serve as a guard, the bodyguard is a warrior specifically trained to protect a charge. Bodyguards need to be just as adept in battle as any other fighter, but they cannot content themselves with that. In any situation, their first thought must be not how to defeat the enemy, but how to best protect their charge. They remain alert for ambushes, test food for poison, and identify liars and deceivers. Many bodyguards become skilled bargainers so that they can deal with situations that force of arms cannot solve.

##### Class Skills

The bodyguard's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Listen]] (Wis), [[Ride]] (Dex), Search (Int), [[Sense Motive]] (Wis), and [[Spot]] (Wis).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the bodyguard.

**Bonus Feats**: The bodyguard gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the bodyguard must select bonus feats from the following list: Alertness, Animal Affinity, Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Improved Shield Bash, Improved Trip, Investigator, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Negotiator, Persuasive, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Run, Spring Attack, Toughness, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

**Special Abilities**: The bodyguard can choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Cover_: The bodyguard can give an adjacent creature the benefit of her shield bonus to Armor Class or the dodge bonus provided by use of the Combat Expertise feat, or both, as a free action. If the bodyguard wishes, she may give her shield bonus to one adjacent creature and her dodge bonus due to Combat Expertise to a different adjacent creature as a free action. When the bodyguard does this, she does not gain these benefits to her AC. If an adjacent creature gaining protection moves more than 5 feet from the bodyguard, it immediately loses the defensive bonus. The dodge bonus or shield bonus provided by the bodyguard stack with such bonuses the protected character already has.

_Clear the Path_: The bodyguard gains the Cleave and Great Cleave feats, but they only apply when the bodyguard fights defensively, uses the Combat Expertise feat, or gives her shield bonus to another creature by using the cover special ability.

#### Bonded Armor

You perform a powerful ritual to tie a particular suit of armor to you.

**Level**: 8th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 8th level.

**Benefit**: Starting at 8th level, you can form an eldritch bond with a specific suit of armor, providing you with greater protection. Bonding requires you to wear the same specific suit of heavy armor every day for at least 30 days (for at least 8 hours per day), followed by a 24-hour-long ritual involving 100 gp worth of incense and magical components. The act of bonding makes the armor a part of you, allowing you to don or remove it as full-round action. In addition, as long as you are awake and can move freely, the armor grants you a +1 insight bonus to your Armor Class. While worn, this bonus increases by an additional +1 at 14th and 20th levels (to +2 and +3, respectively). This is a supernatural ability.

#### Commander

Commanders are soldiers trained in recognizing and using other's abilities in battle along with their own skill. These men and women can lead hordes and armies, take charge of a battalion of soldiers, or even direct a small group of elite troops, such as a party of adventurers.

##### Class Skills

The commander's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Knowledge]] (architecture and engineering) (Int), Profession (siege engineer) (Wis), [[Ride]] (Dex), Sense Motive (Cha), and [[Spot]] (Wis).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the commander.

**Bonus Feats**: The commander gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the commander must select bonus feats from the following list: Alertness, Animal Affinity, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Shield Bash, Iron Will, Leadership, Mobility, Mounted Combat, Negotiator, Persuasive, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spring Attack, Toughness, Trample, Weapon Focus, Whirlwind Attack.

**Special Abilities**: The commander can choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Helpful Hints_: By standing back and surveying a fight, the commander can shout quick directions to his comrades, pointing out openings and incoming attacks. This allows the commander to use the aid another action from up to 60 feet away, giving an ally in melee combat with an opponent a +2 bonus to her next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC for the next attack against her that opponent makes, so long as the attack comes before the commander's next turn. The commander must use a standard action and successfully make an attack roll against AC to as normal. In addition, the ally must be able to hear and understand the commander.

_Rousing Speech_: Whether it's before the battle or in the midst of it, commanders have a way of delivering stirring speeches that inspire those who stand with them. As a full-round action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, the commander can give such a speech to his companions, providing allies within 60 feet with a +1 morale bonus to attacks for 1 round. The commander must succeed at a Diplomacy check (DC 15). The effects of his speech last 1 additional round for each point by which the commander's roll exceeds the DC. The commander may use this ability once per day for every two commander class levels he has; he cannot take this ability until 2nd level.

#### Corsair

The corsair is a marine warrior as deadly with her blade as any landlubber soldier and twice as dangerous in her home territory - the shifting decks of a ship. She scorns heavy armor for fear of drowning, but that only forces her to be more skillful, cagey, and dangerous. Prettier pirates might charm their victims into giving over riches; the corsair takes plunder by might.

##### Class Skills

The corsair's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), [[Climb]] (Str), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Jump]] (Str), Profession (sailor) (Wis), Use Rope (Dex), [[Spot]] (Wis), and [[Swim]] (Str).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the corsair.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The corsair is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: The corsair gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the corsair must select bonus feats from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Athletic, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved Trip, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Skill Focus (any class skill), Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

**Special Abilities**: The corsair gains one of the following special abilities for free at 1st and 2nd level and may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Climb-Fighting_: The corsair becomes so used to fighting in the rigging of a ship that she is no longer considered flat-footed when climbing.

_Rope Movement_: The corsair may use the Use Rope skill in place of Tumble when trying to move through threatened areas, provided there is rigging, rope, vine, or something else from which she can swing. Like with Tumble, 5 or more ranks in Jump grant a +2 synergy bonus to Use Rope checks made to tumble past foes.

_Slow Fall_: Whenever the corsair is within reach of a sail, tapestry, or similar item, she may use it to slow her fall provided she has a bladed weapon in her hand, driving the blade through the cloth and riding it down. A corsair with this ability could also use a rope or pole to slow her fall provided it can fit in her hand. When using this ability, the corsair treats the fall as 30 feet shorter than its actual distance for purposes of calculating damage. The corsair may take this ability multiple times, and the distance stacks each time, but the corsair can only slow her fall for the length of the cloth or rope. The corsair can additionally use the Jump and Tumble skills to treat the fall as a shorter distance if she wishes.

_Swinging Bull Rush_: Grabbing a rope and swinging hard, the corsair plants both heels into an opponent, sending him stumbling back. If the corsair can swing from something while making a bull rush attack, she can use the momentum to her benefit. For every 5 feet swung in the attack, add +1 to the opposed Strength check. If the corsair wins the opposed check, she forces the opponent back an additional 5 feet; the corsair does not need to move with the opponent for these 5 feet. This attack still provokes an attack of opportunity unless the corsair has the Improved Bull Rush feat.

_Big Breath_: The corsair learns to control her need for air. When she must start making Constitution checks to avoid drowning, the corsair only needs to make the check every other round. The check still increases by one each time, but because a check is made every other round, it increases at half the normal rate.

_Ocean Tangle_: When grappling underwater, the corsair's expertise in swimming grants her mobility denied to other creatures. Whenever the corsair is in water deep enough to swim in, she can use a Swim check instead of a grapple check in any opposed grapple check.




#### Counterattack

Every offensive move creates an opening for a counterattack, and you know how to exploit this facet of combat to its fullest.

**Level**: 12th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 12th level.

**Benefit**: At 12th level, you learn to hold back some of your offensive prowess to enable a potent counterattack. As a full-round action, make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus. At any time before the start of your next turn, you can use an immediate action to make a melee attack (using your highest base attack bonus) against an enemy that attacks you in melee.

#### Darksong Knight

The Darksong Knights are elite soldiers of Eilistraee who further her many causes and hunt the yochlol, the demonic servants of the Spider Queen. They develop an intricate, dancelike style of swordplay and special powers to defeat their demonic enemies.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Darksong Knight substitution level, a character must have Eilistraee as her patron deity, be a member of the Darksong Knights, have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take her 2nd, 6th, or 8th level of fighter.

##### Class Skills

Darksong Knight substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class plus Perform (dance).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Darksong Knight Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+2|+3|+0|+0|Bonus feat, dancing feint|
|6th|+6/+1|+5|+2|+2|Bonus feat, favored enemy (yochlols +2)|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+2|+2|Bonus feat, combat dancing|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Darksong Knight substitution levels.

**Bonus Feat**: A Darksong Knight's choice of bonus feats is identical to a standard fighter's bonus feats.

**Dancing Feint (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a Darksong Knight can use her Perform (dance) skill to feint in combat as if it were the Bluff skill.

**Favored Enemy (Ex)**: At 4th level, a Darksong Knight gains yochlols as a favored enemy, just as if she were a 1st-level ranger. Unlike standard ranger favored enemies, which are classified by monster type, the Knight's favored enemy bonuses apply only to yochlols, not all kinds of demons.

**Combat Dancing (Ex)**: At 8th level, a Darksong Knight with at least 5 ranks in Perform (dance) gains a +2 dodge bonus against attacks of opportunity. If she uses Spring Attack, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the attack roll made as part of the maneuver.

#### Dead Levels

The fighter, with nine dead levels (one at every odd level), has one of the most logical progressions of special abilities. They gain a bonus feat every two levels if you imagine the first bonus feat to be granted during a conceptual "0" level for apprentices. As an option-based class, their dead level abilities also incorporate a degree of choice in keeping with the overall fighter level design.

**Physical Prowess (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter gets a bonus to some aspect of his ability checks that makes him a better warrior. The fighter gains an additional bonus at 5th level and every two fighter levels thereafter (7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th). The bonus must be drawn from the following list.

_Applied Force (Ex)_: A fighter can administer force to the weakest points of inanimate objects effectively, giving the character a +1 bonus on Strength checks to break or burst items (see [[Breaking Items]]).

_Combat Bearing (Ex)_: A fighter can steady himself to fight in precarious situations, giving the character a +1 bonus on Dexterity checks to avoid falling when damaged while balancing or moving quickly across difficult surfaces (see [[Balance]]).

_Stamina Reserve (Ex)_: A fighter can push his body more than normal, giving the character a +1 bonus on Constitution checks to continue [[running]] and to avoid nonlethal damage from a [[forced march]].

#### Dirty Fighter

Some fighters prefer stealth and cunning over martial skill. This variant can also be combined with the [[#thug]] variant

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Bonus feats.

**Gain**: Sneak attack (as [[rogue]].

#### Dragonscale Husk

Any warrior knows that skill in battle isn't enough; you must also guard against the attacks of your enemies. A well-forged suit of armor can mean the difference between life and death, but a warrior whose very body is his armor has an immediate advantage. Those who have the blood of dragons running in their veins can gain this benefit.

**Class**: Any standard class that grants proficiency in heavy armor, such as fighter or paladin.

**Level**: 1st (unless the class grants proficiency in heavy armor at a level other than 1st, in which case this feature can be taken only at that level).

**Special Requirement**: You must be of the dragonblood subtype to select this alternative class feature. As long as you gain the dragonblood subtype at the same level that you would gain heavy armor proficiency, you can select this class feature, even if you would normally choose class features before selecting the option that grants you the subtype. For example, a 1st-level human fighter who takes Dragontouched as one of his 1st-level feats could also select this class feature.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that profi ciency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that proficiency in order to select this class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick, scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours to grow, but this process can take place at night while you are sleeping.

Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the class that granted you heavy armor proficiency (+7 bonus to AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to AC at 6th level, and so on, up to a maximum +12 bonus to AC at 18th level). Multiple classes that grant this proficiency stack for determining the dragonscale husk's total bonus. This bonus doesn't stack with any feat, racial trait, or other special ability that would grant you a bonus to Armor Class.

In addition, as you attain higher levels, your husk grants you increasing resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. You gain resistance 5 at 5th level, resistance 10 at 10th level, resistance 15 at 15th level, and resistance 20 at 20th level.

Your dragonscale husk is treated as medium armor for the purpose of determining your speed and whether you can use class features or other special abilities. It allows a maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +2 and has an armor check penalty of -4. You can sleep in your husk without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while your husk is present.

Your husk isn't treated as armor for the purpose of being affected by spells or other abilities. You can't grant it an enhancement bonus with magic vestment, nor can you imbue it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of armor.

You can't take off your dragonscale husk, but you can choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that crumble to dust if handled.

#### Drow Fighter

Drow fighters strike fast and melt away before their opponents have a chance to mount a counterattack. Rather than using heavy armor or picking feats that emphasize direct assaults, drow fighters employ techniques that exploit their natural advantages.

In exchange for a fighter's access to heavy armor, a drow fighter gains strong first-strike capability.

##### Hit-and-Run Tactics

The drow specialize in guerrilla warfare, picking off their foes with poisoned bolts and slipping away into the darkness. Each attack wears their opponents down, until their numbers are so reduced that the drow can sweep in and capture them. If you select the hit-and-run tactics class feature, you sacrifice some AC, but make up for the loss with improved reflexes and accuracy when attacking unsuspecting foes.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: By selecting the hit-and-run alternative class feature, you give up proficiency with heavy armor and tower shields, even if you already have those proficiencies from another class. You can't gain either of these proficiencies by multiclassing later, but you can gain them by selecting the appropriate feats.

**Benefit**: At 1st level, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks.

In addition, when attacking a flat-footed opponent within 30 feet, you can add your Dexterity bonus (if any) as a competence bonus on weapon damage rolls.

#### Dungeon Crasher

Survival in a dungeon requires more than skill at arms and a stout shield. Traps, hazards, falling portcullises, and other threats can pose as much danger as an enraged troll. But you cannot help your impetuous nature. When others might move ahead cautiously and search for traps and other hidden dangers, you charge forward, ignoring the traps you set off and splintering doors and obstacles.

**Level**: 2nd.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feats at 2nd level and at 6th level.

**Benefit**: You excel at overwhelming traps, smashing through doors, and pushing aside your enemies. At 2nd level, you gain a +2 competence bonus on saves and to your Armor Class when attacked by traps. You also gain a +5 bonus on Strength checks to break a door, wall, or similar obstacle.

In addition, you gain a special benefit when making a bull rush. If you force an opponent to move into a wall or other solid object, he stops as normal. However, your momentum crushes him against it, dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 4d6 points + twice your Strength bonus (if any).

At 6th level, the bonuses when dealing with traps increase to +4, and the bonus on Strength checks to break objects increases to +10. The damage you deal when bull rushing an opponent into a wall increases to 8d6 points + three times your Strength bonus.

#### Dwarf Fighter

The prototypical image of dwarfhood is the heavily armored fighter. Many dwarves pursue this class, and most multiclass dwarves have at least a single level of fighter to augment their abilities.

The dwarf fighter gives up versatility to specialize in the arts of war most needed in dwarf communities. He focuses on traditional fighting styles and takes advantage of the dwarf's lack of mobility.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a dwarf fighter substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 8th level of fighter.

##### Class Skills

Dwarf fighter substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class plus [[Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Dwarf Fighter Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Axe focus|
|2nd|+2|+3|+0|+0|Racial foes|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+2|+2|Heavy armor expertise|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the dwarf fighter's racial substitution levels.

**Axe Focus (Ex)**: A dwarf fighter who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level focuses his combat talents on axefi ghting. He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the following weapons: battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, throwing axe, and the axe head of a dwarven urgrosh. (At the DM's option, this bonus might also apply to other axe-related weapons.)

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but it is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for the purpose of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that requires that feat. For example, a dwarf fighter with this ability could take Weapon Specialization (battleaxe) without selecting Weapon Focus (battleaxe) as a separate feat.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 1st-level fighter.

**Racial Foes (Ex)**: A dwarf fighter who takes the 2nd-level racial substitution level specializes in battling his race's common enemies. He gains a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against orcs, goblinoids, and giants.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 2nd-level fighter.

**Heavy Armor Expertise (Ex)**: A dwarf fighter who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level becomes as one with his heavy armor. When wearing heavy armor, he gains a +1 bonus to his AC.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 8th-level fighter.

#### Eldritch Grace

You can sense the subtle warping of reality caused by magic.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 4th level.

**Benefit**: Starting at 4th level, eldritch insight allows you to move with preternatural grace. You gain evasion against spells and magical effects as long as you are unencumbered or lightly encumbered. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Eldritch Juggernaut

Heavy armor you wear protects you from more than just physical attacks.

**Level**: 18th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 18th level.

**Benefit**: Beginning at 18th level, while wearing medium or heavy armor you gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your Hit Dice. This is a supernatural effect that does not stack with any other spell resistance you have.

#### Elusive Attack

You know that the key to winning any fight is not getting hit, so you trade offensive power for a steadier defense.

**Level**: 6th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 6th level.

**Benefit**: At 6th level, you master a technique of combining offense and defense. As a full-round action, make one attack at your highest base attack bonus. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus improves to +4 at 11th level and to +6 at 16th level.

#### Exoticist

Some fighters train so they can seek adventure. Others turn their training into an adventure. Exoticists forgo training in traditional, mundane weapons and focus solely on the rare and bizarre. They rely not only on their ability to wield these weapons, but on their opponent's inability to counter them.

##### Class Skills

The exoticist's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Climb]] (Str), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Jump]] (Str), [[Swim]] (Str), and Tumble (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the exoticist.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The exoticist is proficient in the use of simple weapons, all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields (including tower shields). The exoticist also gains proficiency with four exotic weapons at 1st level.

**Bonus Feats**: The exoticist gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the exoticist must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to an exotic weapon that the exoticist is proficient with): Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Far Shot, Great Cleave, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Initiative, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Sunder, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Manyshot, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot, Shot on the Run, Spring Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

**Special Abilities**: The exoticist may choose any of the following in place of a bonus feat. To use any of the abilities described below, the exoticist must wield an exotic weapon with which she is proficient.

_Dazzling Display_: By making a flamboyant display of her weapon, the exoticist hides attack maneuvers, suddenly lashing out with an unexpected blow. The exoticist gains a +4 bonus to Bluff checks to feint in combat.

_Exotic Attack_: The exoticist not only learns to wield strange weapons, but to wield them strangely, and this unusual technique is more difficult to counter. The exoticist gains a +2 bonus to opposed trip attempts she initiates using her exotic weapon and opposed disarm rolls.

_Strange Strike_: The exoticist learns to fully exploit her [[Knowledge]] of exotic fighting styles. She gains a +1 competence bonus to all attack rolls if her opponent is not proficient with the weapon the exoticist wields.

#### Fencer

Some fight for riches, others for the love of combat. The fencer fights for pride and personal honor. He is a refined warrior trained in a specialized style of combat steeped in ritual and rule, for only a proper fight will satisfy his honor. Some call him a dandy or a fop, but few would dare say so to his face. He might stink of expensive perfume and lack the calluses of labor on his hands, but his sword is as sharp as any grizzled mercenary's, and his life of luxury only leaves him more time to train - as the foolish learn the hard way.

##### Class Skills

The fencer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Bluff]] (Cha), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Ride]] (Dex), and Tumble (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the fencer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The fencer is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with the buckler.

**Bonus Feats**: The fencer gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the fencer must select bonus feats from the following list: Acrobatic, Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Initiative, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Persuasive, Quick Draw, Shield Proficiency, Skill Focus (any class skill), Spring Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

**Special Abilities**: Starting at 4th level, the fencer may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Encouraging Blow_: Whenever the fencer scores a threat against an opponent, regardless of whether it becomes a successful critical, he gains a +3 morale bonus to his Armor Class against that foe's attacks for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum of 1). If the threat becomes a critical, double the morale bonus. This ability does not work against creatures with an Intelligence score lower than 3 or those immune to mind-influencing effects.

_Denigrating Banter_: The fencer's method of fighting assaults his opponent's self-confidence and pride. Taunts and jibes are as integral to his methods as feints and thrusts. However, an accomplished fencer can do more than insult his opponent: he can add great weight to his superior air, cowing others. As a standard action, the fencer may bait and taunt a foe. The fencer and the target creature make an opposed Charisma check. If the target creature fails to equal the fencer's Charisma check, its base attack bonus is penalized by -2. This penalty increases by one for every 5 points by which the creature failed to equal the fencer's Charisma check. If the target's base attack bonus slips below the minimum required for any feat, special ability, or prestige class she possesses, she loses use of it until her base attack bonus again meets the requirement. A target whose base attack falls below what is needed to make multiple attacks with a full attack loses the appropriate number of attacks. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the fencer's Charisma bonus plus 1 (minimum of 1). The effects of multiple denigrating banter attempts do not stack. This is a language-dependant, sonic, mind-affecting effect. Creatures who cannot understand or hear the fencer are immune. A fencer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma bonus.

_Insurmountable Counter_: With a quick read of his opponent, the fencer identifies one of his foe's techniques and assumes a fighting posture that nullifies it. When attacked by a foe using Power Attack or Combat Expertise, the fencer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC.

#### Fortification

The armor you wear protects you in more ways than in just avoiding harm.

**Level**: 10th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feats at 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.

**Benefit**: Beginning at 10th level, when you wear heavy armor there is a 25% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack scored against you is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. The negation chance increases to 75% at 14th level and 100% at 18th level. This is a supernatural effect that does not stack with any other fortification you have.

#### Golarion Fighter

Numerous martial academies around the Inner Sea region teach weapon skill, tactics, diplomacy, and other tools useful for war. Fighters who attend these schools may choose the above option, which replaces the bonus feat gained upon taking the first level of fighter.

**Class Skills**: A fighter trained at a famous war college or fighting school gains the following class skills (in addition to the normal fighter class skills): [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), [[Knowledge]] (architecture and engineering) (Int), [[Knowledge]] (geography) (Int), [[Knowledge]] (nobility and royalty) (Int), [[Sense Motive]] (Wis).

**Skill Points at 1st Level**: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

**Skill Points at Each Additional Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

#### Half-Elf Fighter

Lacking the bonus feat of humans and the high Dexterity of elves, half-elf fighters are not particularly common. Those who do take up a life of the blade often become talkative swashbucklers who blend quick swordplay with a sharp tongue. They seek to confuse and demoralize foes, rather than overcoming them with brute force.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a half-elf fighter substitution level, a character must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 6th level of fighter.

##### Class Skills

Half-elf fighter substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class, plus Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Half-Elf Fighter Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Blade focus|
|2nd|+2|+3|+0|+0|Main-gauche|
|6th|+6/+1|+5|+2|+2|Confusing banter|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the half-elf fighter racial substitution levels.

**Blade Focus (Ex)**: The half-elf fighter focuses his combat talents on fighting with slender blades. At 1st level, the half-elf fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the longsword and rapier.

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for the purposes of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and so on that require the feat. For example a half-elf fighter with this ability could take Weapon Specialization (rapier) without selecting Weapon Focus (rapier) as a separate feat.

This benefit replaces the standard fighter's 1st-level bonus feat.

**Main-Gauche (Ex)**: At 2nd level, the half-elf fighter learns how to fight using a dagger in his off-hand in defense as well as offense. The half-elf fighter is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when wielding a longsword or rapier in one hand and a dagger in his other hand. In addition, the half-elf fighter gains a +1 bonus to AC during any round that fights defensively while wielding weapons in this manner.

This bonus is treated as the equivalent of Two-Weapon Fighting for the purposes of qualifying for feats and prestige classes that require the feat.

This benefit replaces the standard fighter's 2nd-level bonus feat.

**Confusing Banter (Ex)**: The 6th-level half-elf fighter combines defensive tactics with a stream of wordplay aimed at tricking his opponent into letting his guard down. Whenever a half-elf fighter fights defensively, he may attempt a Bluff or Diplomacy check as a free action, opposed by his opponent's Sense Motive check (the opponent may also add his base attack bonus on this check). If the half-elf fighter wins, he gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that creature until the end of his next turn. This ability only functions against creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. It is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability.

This benefit replaces the standard fighter's 6th-level bonus feat.

#### Horseman

Horsemen trade encumbering armor for enhanced mobility and swap a single devastating lance charge for a series of punishing ride-by attacks. Rather than run roughshod over the front lines, these warriors weave their way through the ranks and leave trails of corpses behind them.

##### Class Skills

The horseman's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), [[Craft]] (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Jump]] (Str), [[Ride]] (Dex), and Tumble (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the horseman.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The horseman is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: The horseman gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the horseman must select bonus feats from the following list: Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Cleave, Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Cleave, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Power Attack, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

**Special Abilities**: The horseman may choose any of the following special abilities instead of a bonus feat.

_Quick Turn_: When making a charge on a mount, the horseman may make a number of turns, each not more than 90 degrees, equal to the mount's Dexterity modifier. To do this, the horseman must succeed at a Ride check (DC 15) at each turn or the charge becomes a double move and the mount cannot attack.

_Share Shield_: The horseman may share his shield bonus with his mount as a move action by making a successful Ride check (DC 15).

_Spur_: The horseman can urge his mount to greater speeds, adding 10 feet to the mount's base speed for one round. A mount can be spurred a number of times per day equal to its Constitution bonus.

_Steady Hand_: The horseman develops such a sense of trust with his mount that he can help it overcome its primal fears and foreign influences. Any time the mount must succeed at a Will save to overcome a mind-influencing effect, the horseman may make a Ride check (DC 10 + spell DC). If successful, treat the roll as a successful Will save for the mount.

#### Janissary

Created circa 1330 CE, the conscripted troops of the Ottoman army, called janissaries, operated under the system of devshirme (dev-shuhr-MEH). In this system, children of subjects (most often Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians) were taken from their families, raised as warriors, and indoctrinated into the culture and religion of those they served. Subject to strict rules and limited freedoms, the fierce and loyal janissaries held the highest moral standards and often practiced celibacy to enhance martial focus. Musically inclined, their heavy, intimidating tunes accompanied them into combat.

The emperor Murad I created the janissaries to replace the empire's fragmented tribal army with a loyal force. However, the group's power to influence events and defend their own interests led to a virtual state within a state and the eventual involvement of the janissary corps in coups against the empire.

Janissaries are usually lawful and most often neutral, but their order accepts all alignments.

Janissaries worship the deities of those they serve and often recognize their mortal lords as divine inhabitants of the Material Plane. The indoctrination of devshirme overcomes any racial differences between a janissary and its master. A human janissary could serve a half-orc without question and vice versa.

Learned and skilled in arts beyond those martial, janissaries know more of the world than most other fighters and speak of such things as architecture and historical events - often doing so in strange tongues.

Feats appropriate to janissaries include Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm, Improved Sunder (janissaries often sunder weapons and shields or attempt to disarm their foes with their first attacks), and some of the new feats from Heroes of Battle (such as Veteran [[Knowledge]]). Pious good-aligned janissaries sometimes take exalted feats, especially Vow of Chastity and Vow of Obedience. In addition, janissaries have developed certain methods for which they have become famous, as modeled by the feat Combat Engineer.

Fiercely loyal, janissaries possess a single-mindedness in combat rightly feared by their opponents. They tend to forgo heavy armor for greater stealth and speed, while preferring heavy blades like the greatsword.

The janissary is a variant fighter. Unless otherwise noted, a janissary advances in the same manner as a fighter (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of fighter or janissary, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level fighter twice.

##### Class Skills

A janissary gains Speak Language and two [[Knowledge]] skills (of his choice) as class skills, but Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Swim become cross-class skills for him.

#### Kensai

Instead of investing their time in learning how to wield all manner of weapons, some warriors spend all of their time training with a single melee weapon and become masters of it almost from the start of their adventuring careers. These warriors are known as kensai. Although the word literally means "sword saint," a kensai can devote herself to any weapon she chooses. There are kensai of axes, maces, even flails and spiked chains. What defines the kensai is the single-minded devotion to a particular weapon, not the weapon itself.

##### Class Skills

The kensai's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), [[Concentration]] (Con), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Jump]] (Str), Tumble (Dex), and [[Swim]] (Str).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the kensai.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The kensai is proficient in the use of all simple weapons, light armor, and a single martial or exotic melee weapon that is the kensai's chosen weapon.

**Bonus Feats**: The kensai does not gain a bonus feat at 1st level like the normal fighter class does. Instead. the kensai gains a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls with her chosen weapon. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and increases by +1 again every five levels thereafter.

The kensai gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the kensai must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to the kensai's chosen weapon): Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Great Cleave, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved-Two Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spring Attack, Two-Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

**Special Abilities**: The kensai can choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat. These abilities only apply to the kensai's chosen weapon.

_Rain of Blows_: When taking the full attack action with her chosen weapon, the kensai can choose to suffer a -3 penalty to all attack rolls in the round and make an additional melee attack with her chosen weapon at her highest attack bonus.

_Storm of Blows_: When taking the full attack action with her chosen weapon, the kensai can suffer a -6 penalty to all attack rolls in the round and make two additional melee attacks with her chosen weapon at her highest attack bonus. The kensai must have the rain of blows special ability to take this ability.

#### Knight

Knights, both good and bad, are the masters of mounted combat and command, and the elite of noble soldiers. Only after many years of menial tasks, such as tending to the horses, taking care of the weapons and armor, and fixing meals, all occasionally broken up with lessons from a master, does a squire graduate to knighthood. Those without the perseverance to complete the apprenticeship never earn the title "Sir."

##### Class Skills

The knight's class skills (and the key abil-ity for each skill) are [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Heal]] (Wis), [[Jump]] (Str), and [[Ride]] (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the knight.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The knight is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields (except tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: The knight gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the knight must select bonus feats from the following list: Athletic, Combat Reflexes, Cleave, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun. Improved Sunder, Mobility, Mounted Combat, Negotiator, Power Attack, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Toughness, Trample, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

**Special Abilities**: The knight may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Hard Charge_: When a knight makes a mounted charge, both the knight's and the mount's attacks gain a +2 bonus to damage so long as the mount has moved a distance equal to or greater than its speed.

_Jousting Charge_: If the knight has a heavy or light shield readied when making a mounted charge, he does not suffer a -2 penalty to his Armor Class (but his mount still does).

_Staggered Gait_: If the knight successfully overruns an opponent using the Trample feat, his mount may take a -2 penalty to all its attack rolls for the round in order to gain a second hoof attack against the tripped opponent. The knight must have the Trample feat to take this ability.

_Vicious Mount_: The knight works with his mount to make it especially potent when it attacks. The mount's attacks gain a +1 bonus to damage when the knight is riding the mount.

#### Kobold Fighter

Kobold fighters train to master the use of the spear, the traditional weapon of kobolds. They forego learning how to use some armor in exchange for learning to dodge attacks. Kobold fighters exercise arduously throughout their careers, striving to overcome some of the physical deficiencies they inherit as kobolds.

**Hit Die**: d10.

##### Requirements

To take a kobold fighter substitution level, a character must be a kobold about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 4th level of fighter.

##### Class Skills

Kobold fighter substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class, plus Profession (miner) and Search.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Kobold Fighter Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Dodge, spear focus|
|2nd|+2|+3|+0|+0|Constitution boost (Con +2)|
|4th|+4|+4|+1|+1|Strength boost (Str +2)|

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the kobold fighter racial substitution levels.

**Spear Focus (Ex)**: A 1st-level kobold fighter focuses his combat talents on spear fighting. He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the following weapons: longspear, shortspear, and spear. At the DM's option, this bonus might also apply to other spearlike weapons.

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but it is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that requires that feat. A kobold fighter who has this ability could take Weapon Specialization (spear) without selecting Weapon Focus (spear) as a separate feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's 1st-level bonus feat and medium armor proficiency.

**Dodge (Ex)**: A kobold fighter who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains Dodge as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's heavy armor proficiency.

**Constitution Boost (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a kobold fighter increases his Constitution score by 2 points.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

**Strength Boost (Ex)**: A kobold fighter who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level increases his Strength score by 2 points.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's bonus feat gained at 4th level.

#### Overpowering Attack

You never waste time wounding your opponent, instead concentrating on delivering one solid strike.

**Level**: 16th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 16th level.

**Benefit**: At 16th level, you can focus your attention in combat to deliver a single deadly attack. As a full-round action, make one attack at your highest base attack bonus. That attack deals double damage, as do any other attacks you make before the start of your next turn.

#### Planar Fighter

Planar travelers often have some fighting skill. Those devoting a substantial amount of time and effort to the pursuit of planar puissance gain additional powers and tactics useful against planar foes.

**Hit Die**: d10.

##### Requirements

To take a fighter planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 4th, 8th, or 12th level of fighter.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Fighter planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class plus [[Knowledge]] (the planes).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Fighter Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4th|+4|+4|+1|+1|Planar study|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+2|+2|Align puissance|
|12th|+12/+7/+2|+8|+4|+4|Aura of stability|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the fighter's planar substitution levels.

**Planar Study (Ex)**: At 4th level, a planar fighter learns the secrets of combating foes encountered on the planes. He gains a +2 bonus on all weapon damage rolls against elementals, outsiders, and creatures that would have the extraplanar subtype while on the Material Plane (such as a fiendish dire wolf).

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard fighter at 4th level.

**Align Puissance (Su)**: Once per day, for a number of rounds equal to his fighter class level, a planar fighter of 8th level or higher can use a standard action to align himself so that any weapon he wields is aligned good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as he chooses. A weapon that is aligned can overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment.

This ability has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment, such as a holy sword. It affects all other weapons wielded by the fighter, but not his unarmed strikes or natural weapons. The ability comes from the fighter, not the weapon, so if he subsequently gives away or loses the weapon, it does not remain aligned. Likewise, while the fighter is under the effect of this ability, any weapon he picks up acts as if aligned in the manner he activated.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard fighter at 8th level.

**Aura of Stability (Su)**: As a standard action, a planar fighter of 12th level or higher can activate a [[dimensional anchor]] effect on himself with a duration of a number of rounds equal to his class level. In addition, anyone with whom he is grappling is likewise affected by the dimensional anchor ability while they are grappling. Spell resistance applies, and the caster level of the ability equals the fighter's class level.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard fighter at 12th level.

#### Pugilist

Pugilists don't waste time learning a large assortment of weapons. Instead they master the simplest of weapons: their own hands. They are boxers and brawlers; tough people who punch hard and weather savage beatings. While often harsh in their fighting and brutal in their appearance, they are, by the very nature of their fighting style, more merciful than most. While fights with more traditionally armed fighters end with dead littering the ground, fights with pugilism end with battered, unconscious opponents.

##### Class Skills

The pugilist's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Bluff]] (Cha), [[Climb]] (Str), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Sense Motive]] (Wis), [[Spot]] (Wis), and [[Swim]] (Str).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the pugilist.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The pugilist is proficient in the use of all simple weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light).

**Bonus Feats**: The pugilist gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the pugilist must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to unarmed strike): Alertness, Athletic, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Bull Rush.

**Special Abilities**: The pugilist gains the Improved Unarmed Strike and Endurance feats for free at 1st level. In addition, her unarmed strikes inflict 1d4 points of damage per strike. Small pugilists inflict 1d3 points of damage. The pugilist may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Combo_: The pugilist practices a series of blows designed to flow one after the other, each one setting up the next. When using a combo, average the pugilist's first two unarmed strike attacks in a full attack and use the resulting bonus for both strikes. For example, a pugilist with a +10/+5 attack progression has a +7/+7 attack progression when using a combo. The pugilist can take this ability more than once, each time adding one more attack gained from a high base attack bonus to the combo.

_Heavy Hitting_: The pugilist's unarmed strikes inflict an extra +2 nonlethal damage, even when the pugilist strikes to deal lethal damage. The pugilist can take this ability multiple times but cannot take it until 2nd level.

_Iron Jaw_: Whenever the pugilist suffers nonlethal damage, the damage is reduced by a number equal to the pugilist's Constitution bonus. The pugilist also gains a +1 bonus to saves to resist any attack that would leave her stunned.

_Shake it Off_: The pugilist develops non-lethal damage only and reduces the duration of all stunning effects by 1 round, with a minimum of 1 round. The pugilist can take this ability multiple times; its effects stack.



#### Raptoran Fighter

The raptoran fighter is a sentinel of the skies, swooping on foes and bringing death from above. A raptoran fighter gives up some of her versatility and defensive prowess, but gains significant airborne advantages.

**Hit Die**: d10.

##### Requirements

To take a raptoran fighter substitution level, a character must be a raptoran about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of fighter.

##### Class Skills

Raptoran fighter substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard fighter class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the raptoran fighter's racial substitution levels.

**Encumbered Flight (Ex)**: A 1st-level raptoran fighter can glide while carrying a medium load. When the character gains flight after undertaking her Walk of the Four Winds, she can fly while carrying a medium load.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's heavy armor proficiency gained at 1st level.

**Airborne Strike (Ex)**: A 4th-level raptoran fighter gains the ability to use superior positioning to deal extra damage in melee. Whenever the raptoran is flying and higher than her opponent, she gains a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's bonus feat gained at 4th level.

**Fast Flight (Ex)**: An 8th-level raptoran fighter's glide and fly speeds are 10 feet faster than the norm for her race. Fast flight is considered a racial bonus to speed, so it stacks with enhancement bonuses from spells and magic items.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's bonus feat gained at 8th level.

  

**Table: Raptoran Fighter Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+0|+0|Encumbered flight, bonus feat|
|4th|+4|+4|+1|+1|Airborne strike|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+2|+2|Fast flight|

  

#### Resolute

Your faith bolsters your resolve, allowing you to stand firm against all foes.

**Level**: Any even-numbered level.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces one of your fighter bonus feats.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can reduce your base attack bonus by one-half and gain a bonus on your Will save equal to the amount of the reduction. This effect lasts until the end of your next action. This is a supernatural ability.

#### Shield Bearer

Shield bearers are fighters that make the shield their primary focus instead of their weapon. While certainly proficient with a blade, shield bearers possess unparalleled mastery of armor and shields. They often surprise opponents with their technique, parrying with their weapons while smashing back with their shields. When violence comes, they charge to the front ranks, for they are melee fighters first and foremost, eschewing most ranged weapons because of their incompatibility with the warriors beloved shields.

##### Class Skills

The shield bearer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Climb]] (Str), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Jump]] (Str), and [[Ride]] (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the shield bearer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The shield bearer is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields (including tower shields). In addition, shield bearers are proficient with armor spikes.

**Bonus Feats**: Shield bearers must take the Improved Shield Bash feat as their first fighter bonus feat. The shield bearer otherwise gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but she must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to a type of shield for the purposes of making shield bash attacks): Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Mobility, Persuasive, Power Attack, Spring Attack, Stunning Fist, Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

**Special Abilities**: The shield bearer may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Armored Gait_: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer treats the armor as one weight category lighter for determining speed penalties. This does not reduce the armor's weight category for the barbarian bonus movement, ranger class abilities, or other abilities dependent on the armor's weight category. Thus medium armor would not hinder her speed, while heavy armor would still reduce it, but still allow her to run at four times her normal rate. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

_Armored Grace_: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer increases the maximum Dexterity bonus of the armor by one when she wears it. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

_Armor Optimization_: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer adds +1 to the armor bonus of this armor when she wears it, learning to twist and shift in order to take blows on the most protective parts of the armor. The shield bearer loses this bonus whenever she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

_Fortification_: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer adds +2 to the armor bonus of this armor, but this bonus only applies when an opponent is rolling to confirm a critical hit. This armor bonus stacks with all other armor bonuses, including Armor Optimization. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

_Shield Strike_: The shield bearer may use her shield in place of an unarmed attack to perform special maneuvers. Treat the Shield Strike ability as the Improved Unarmed Attack feat for purposes of taking other feats in the unarmed attack chain, such as Stunning Fist and Deflect Arrows. Instead of having a free hand, the shield bearer must have her shield readied in order to use these feats.

#### Survivalist

Survivalists are not nature lovers. They do not see themselves as a part of the wilds, and if they had a choice, they would stay within the confines of civilization. Unfortunately, dangers sometimes force people out of the cities, and when that happens, the survivalist is prepared. These people might not love the wilderness, but they can trap game, make shelter, and find fresh water.

##### Class Skills

The survivalist's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), [[Climb]] (Str), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Hide]] (Dex), [[Jump]] (Str), Move Silently (Dex), [[Survival]] (Wis), [[Swim]] (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the survivalist.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The survivalist is trained in the use of all simple and martial weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: The survivalist gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the survivalist must select bonus feats from the following list: Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Far Shot, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Run, Self-Sufficient, Shot on the Run, Skill Focus (any class skill), Spring Attack, Stealthy, Toughness, Track, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

#### Targetteer

There are archers, there are marksmen, and then there is the targetteer. Focusing on the totality of ranged combat rather than settling on a single weapon, the targetteer is a dangerous opponent, for he possesses a reach often longer than it first appears and deadly accuracy.

##### Class Skills

The targetteer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Climb]] (Str), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Hide]] (Dex), Move Silently (Dex), [[Profession]] (Wis), and [[Ride]] (Dex).

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the targetteer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The targetteer is trained in the use of all simple weapons, all ranged martial weapons, with all armors (light, medium, and heavy), and with the buckler. He may also choose two exotic weapon proficiencies at first level, but these must be ranged weapons.

**Bonus Feats**: The targetteer gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the targetteer must select bonus feats from the following list: Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Far Shot, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Unarmed Strike, Lightning Reflexes, Martial Weapon Proficiency, Manyshot, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot, Run, Shot on the Run, Stealthy, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

**Special Abilities**: The targetteer may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

_Arrow Swarm_: By taking a -5 penalty to all attack rolls for a round, the targetteer may make two additional ranged attacks at his highest attack bonus. The targetteer must have the Rapid Shot feat to take this ability and must be making a full attack to make use of Arrow Swarm.

_Sniper_: When using the full attack option, the targetteer can sacrifice attacks to gain deadly accuracy. For each attack from a full attack sacrificed, the threat range of the targetteer's weapon increases by 1. Thus if the targetteer's ranged attack normally has a threat range of 19-20, sacrificing one attack from a full attack would increase the threat range to 18-20. A sacrificed attack only enhances the next attack. However, a targetteer can sacrifice multiple attacks to further increase the threat range. A targetteer cannot sacrifice all attacks from a full attack action.

_Vital Aim_: The targetteer may add his Dexterity modifier to his damage rolls with a ranged-weapon attack instead of his Strength bonus. The targetteer cannot replace a Strength penalty to damage rolls with his Dexterity modifier unless his Dexterity modifier is also a penalty. The targetteer cannot use his Dexterity modifier to replace his Strength modifier when attacking creatures immune to critical hits.

#### Thane

Thanes are professional fighters sworn to protect a clan or tribal chieftain. Serving as bodyguards, companions, and the commanders of their liege's warbands. Such devoted warriors usually come from the leading or noble families of a liege's country, clan, or tribe. Loyalty is the most important quality for them, and they are expected to die defending or avenging their liege. In return for a thane's faithful service, patrons feed, board, and give gifts to their protectors. Thanes from cultures that esteem mounted warriors often embrace the horseman ideal, while those of other societies adopt whatever form of battle is considered most honorable.

The thane is a specialist fighter, much like an evoker is a specialist wizard. Unless otherwise noted, a thane advances in the same manner as a fighter (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of fighter or thane, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level fighter twice.

##### Class Skills

The thane's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [[Climb]] (Str), [[Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy]] (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), [[Jump]] (Str), [[Ride]] (Dex), and [[Swim]] (Str).

##### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the thane.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A thane is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: The thane gain bonus feats as normal fighters do. In addition to normal fighter bonus feats, the thane may also select Aura of Bravery, Improved Aid Another, and Stalwart as a fighter bonus feat.

**Thane's Vow**: At 1st level, a thane devotes himself to a single lord or master. This lord does not have to be an actual ruler, merely any other character the thane determines as being worthy to serve and who accepts the thane's service. A thane cannot voluntarily change who his lord is for any reason once he has pledged himself to that lord. If the thane's lord is killed, the thane must exact revenge against his master's killers or die in the attempt, and should be treated as if under the effects of geas/quest until this mission is fulfilled (this quest cannot be ended prematurely by a remove curse spell). A lordless thane suffers a -4 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks until he fulfills his vow. After a thane has avenged his previous lord's death, he is free to devote himself to a new lord and must do so to eliminate the penalty on Charisma-based skill checks.

#### Thug

The thug is a street fighter, a survivor who learns to mix brute force with a bit of craftiness. He has most of the fighter's strengths, along with some additional skills to help keep him alive on the mean streets. Despite the name, not all thugs are mere hooligans - many are crafty veterans who use their [[Knowledge]] of the streets to gain an advantage against their opponents.

Most thugs are nonlawful, though sometimes gangs of thugs with a lawful streak band together.

##### Class Skills

Add the following skills to the fighter's class skill list: [[Bluff]], [[Gather Information]], [[Knowledge]] (local), and [[Sleight of Hand]]. The thug gains skill points per level equal to 4 + Int modifier (and has this number x 4 at 1st level).

##### Class Features

The thug has all the standard fighter class features, except as noted below.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Thugs are proficient with all [[simple weapon]] and [[martial weapons]] and with [[light armor]].

**Bonus Feats**: A thug doesn't gain the normal fighter bonus feat at 1st level. Also, add Urban Tracking to the list of fighter bonus feats available to the thug.

#### Warforged Fighter

To many, the words "warforged" and "fighter" seem almost synonymous. Built to serve as soldiers, warforged are indeed singularly suited to the pursuit of the combat arts. The warforged fighter who gives up some of that class's range of options, however, gains a stability in combat and a greater command of his construct body.

**Hit Die**: d12.

##### Requirements

To take a warforged fighter substitution level, a character must be a warforged about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 4th level of fighter.

##### Class Skills
