### RANGER

<br><br>The forests are home to fierce and cunning creatures, such as bloodthirsty owlbears and malicious displacer beasts. But more cunning and powerful than these monsters is the ranger, a skilled hunter and stalker. He knows the woods as if they were his home (as indeed they are), and he knows his prey in deadly detail.<br><br>A ranger often accepts the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. In addition, a ranger carries grudges against certain types of creatures and looks for opportunities to find and destroy them. He may adventure for all the reasons that a fighter does.<br><br>A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. His skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, to find his prey, and to avoid detection. He also has special [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] about certain types of creatures, which makes it easier for him to find and defeat such foes. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does.<br><br>Rangers can be of any alignment. Most are good, and such rangers usually function as protectors of the wild areas. In this role, a ranger seeks out and destroys or drives off evil creatures that threaten the wilderness. Good rangers also protect those who travel through the wilderness, serving sometimes as guides and sometimes as unseen guardians. Most rangers are also chaotic, preferring to follow the ebb and flow of nature or of their own hearts instead of rigid rules. Evil rangers, though rare, are much to be feared. They revel in nature's thoughtless cruelty and seek to emulate her most fearsome predators. They gain divine spells just as good rangers do, for nature herself is indifferent to good and evil.<br><br>Though a ranger gains his divine spells from the power of nature, he like anyone else may worship a chosen deity. Ehlonna (goddess of the woodlands) and Obad-Hai (god of nature) are the most common deities revered by, though some prefer more martial deities.<br><br>Some rangers gained their training as part of special military teams, but most learned their skills from solitary masters who accepted them as students and assistants. The rangers of a particular master may count themselves as cohorts, or they may be rivals for the status of best student and thus the rightful heir to their master's fame.<br><br>Elves often choose the ranger's path. They are at home in the woods, and they have the grace to move stealthily. Half-elves who feel their elf parents' connection to the woods are also likely to adopt this class. Humans are often rangers as well, being adaptable enough to learn their way around the woods even if it doesn't come naturally to them. Half-orcs may find the life of a ranger more comfortable than life among cruel and taunting humans (or orcs). Gnome rangers are more common than gnome fighters, but still they tend to remain in their own lands rather than adventure among "the big people." Dwarf rangers are rare, but they can be quite effective. Instead of living in the surface wilderness, they are at home in the endless caverns beneath the earth. Here they hunt down and destroy the enemies of dwarvenkind with the relentless precision for which dwarves are known. Dwarf rangers are often known as cavers. Halfling rangers are highly respected for their ability to help communities of halflings prosper as they pursue their nomadic lifestyle. Among the savage humanoids, only gnolls are commonly rangers, using their skills to slyly stalk their prey.<br><br>Rangers get along well with druids and to some extent with barbarians. They are known to bicker with paladins, mostly because they often share goals but differ in style, tactics, approach, philosophy, and esthetics. Since rangers don't often look to other people for support or friendship, they find it easy to tolerate people who are quite different from themselves, such as bookish wizards and preachy clerics. They just don't care enough to get upset about others' differences.<br><br>The ranger's best role is that of a scout and secondary combatant. Without the heavy armor of the fighter or the staying power of the barbarian, the ranger should focus on opportunistic and ranged attacks. Most rangers user their animal companions as sentries, scouts, or to assist them in melee combat.|

###### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the ranger.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).

**Favored Enemy (Ex)**: At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on [[Bluff]], [[Listen]], [[Sense Motive]], [[Spot]], and [[Survival]] checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

**Table: Ranger Favored Enemies**

|Type (Subtype)|Type (Subtype)|Type (Subtype)|Type (Subtype)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Aberration|Humanoid (dwarf)|Humanoid (reptilian)|Outsider (fire)|
|Animal|Humanoid (elf)|Magical beast|Outsider (good)|
|Construct|Humanoid (goblinoid)|Monstrous humanoid|Outsider (lawful)|
|Dragon|Humanoid (gnoll)|Ooze|Outsider (native)|
|Elemental|Humanoid (gnome)|Outsider (air)|Outsider (water)|
|Fey|Humanoid (halfling)|Outsider (chaotic)|Plant|
|Giant|Humanoid (human)|Outsider (earth)|Undead|
|Humanoid (aquatic)|Humanoid (orc)|Outsider (evil)|Vermin|

**Track**: A ranger gains [[Track]] as a bonus feat.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)**: A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a [[Diplomacy]] check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.

**Combat Style (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.

If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the [[Rapid Shot]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the [[Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Endurance**: A ranger gains [[Endurance]] as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

**Animal Companion (Ex)**: At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: [[badger]], [[camel]], dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, [[hawk]], horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: [[Crocodile|[[crocodi]]le]], [[porpoise]], [[Shark_Medium|Medium shark]], and [[squid]]. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.

This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the [[Ranger Spells List]]. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.

**Improved Combat Style (Ex)**: At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the [[Manyshot]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the [[Improved Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Woodland Stride (Ex)**: Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

**Swift Tracker (Ex)**: Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A [[helpless]] ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Combat Style Mastery (Ex)**: At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the [[Improved Precise Shot]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the [[Greater Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Camouflage (Ex)**: A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.

**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)**: While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.

#### Arcane Hunter

Rangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy. Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is, and more with what it does. These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals.

**Class**: Ranger.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: At 1st level, you do not select a favored enemy from Table: [[#Ranger Favored Enemies]]. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you can choose favored enemies as normal.

**Benefit**: At 1st level, you gain favored enemy (arcanists). This feature works just like the favored enemy ability. The bonuses granted apply to any character capable of casting arcane spells or using invocations (but not other spell-like abilities).

#### Aquatic Ranger

Rangers of the rivers and seas are often master sailors, expert in the use of watercraft both large and small. They paddle canoes through wild canyons, sail outriggers amid coral reefs, or pilot skiffs along rocky coasts. Among aquatic folk, rangers are hunters and trackers who have become specialized in following their prey through the challenging medium of water. Sahuagin in particular make dangerous aquatic rangers.

**Track in Water**: An aquatic ranger can follow a trail even across streams or underwater. Such terrain cannot hold tracks, but the ranger uses faint scent traces and lingering disturbances in the water to follow the recent passage of his quarry. Since water (especially if moving) quickly washes away the trail, the Survival DC modifier for tracking in water is +10. For each minute that passes since the trail was made, the DC also increases by 1 (or by 5 in flowing water). Tracking through rushing or stormy water is impossible, except to a character under the effect of a wake trailing spell.

**Woodland Stride (Ex)**: A ranger who has a racial swim speed can choose to apply this ability to difficult aquatic terrain (shallow coral, kelp beds, ice-choked waters, sargasso, and similar obstacles), rather than woodland terrain. This choice is made when the class feature is gained.

#### Celestial Slayer

Rangers specialize in hunting and defeating certain sorts of foes. Sometimes, a ranger's choice of enemy - as well as his single-minded pursuit of that enemy's destruction - draws the dread attention of evil entities from the Lower Planes. The character becomes better able to resist and combat the forces of good, at the expense of his soul.

**Class**: Ranger.

**Level**: 1st.

**Special Requirement**: To select this alternative class feature, you must be evil. If your alignment changes to something other than evil, you lose access to this class feature until your alignment is restored to evil.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild empathy, animal companion, or woodland stride.

**Benefit**: You gain spell resistance equal to 10 + your class level against spells and spell-like effects that have the good descriptor.

In addition, when you roll to confirm a critical hit against a creature of the good subtype, you gain a +4 competence bonus on the roll.

#### Champion of the Wild

By surrendering your spellcasting ability, you focus your energies on becoming a weapon master. You gain access to bonus feats much as a fighter does, but focused on your mastery of your chosen combat style.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: To select this class feature, you must sacrifice your spellcasting ability.

**Benefit**: You no longer gain spells as a ranger, but you can now select a bonus feat at 4th, 8th, 11th, and 14th levels. You can choose any feat from the following list for which you meet the prerequisites: Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Eyes in the Back of Your Head, Improved Disarm, Improved Favored Enemy, Improved Feint, and Improved Trip, as well as from one of the following lists, depending on your combat style.

_Archery_: Far Shot, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Rapid Shot, Manyshot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Ranged Disarm, Ranged Pin, Ranged Sunder, Sharp-Shooting, and Shot on the Run.

_Two-Weapon Combat_: Greater Two-Weapon Defense, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Defense, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse.

**Special**: A ranger who selects this path can no longer use scrolls, wands, or other magic items that require access to a spell list, unless he has another spellcasting class that grants access to the appropriate spells.

#### Combat Styles

The Player's Handbook features two combat styles for rangers: archery and two-weapon fighting. History and fantasy abound with stories of hunters and woodsmen who master such weapons as the longbow, the quarterstaff, or the twin blades. However, rangers use many other weapons as well. This article presents five new combat styles for rangers to choose from. The ranger gains the listed feats for the chosen combat style at the appropriate levels, as described on [[#Combat Style]], [[#Improved Combat Style]], and [[#Combat Style Mastery]].

##### BEAST-WRESTLING STYLE

Some rangers eschew weapons and fight with their bare hands. Unlike the graceful style of the monk, the beast wrestler relies on his brute strength to subdue his foes. Originally practiced by rangers living in marshy areas to capture and move dangerous animals (such as crocodiles) without harming them, some adventurous rangers apply these techniques to more exotic foes. Most beast wrestlers choose animal or magical beast as their first favored enemy.

**Combat Style (2nd)**: Improved Unarmed Strike

**Improved Combat Style (6th)**: Improved Grapple

**Combat Style Mastery (11th)**: Stunning Fist

##### MOUNTED-COMBAT STYLE

With their special rapport with animals, rangers readily take to riding. A mounted ranger can use her mount in combat, especially when she utilizes the mounted combat style. Such rangers often choose a horse, riding dog, or some exotic mount as an animal companion, and augment their style with feats from the Mounted Combat feat tree.

**Combat Style (2nd)**: Ride-By Attack

**Improved Combat Style (6th)**: Spirited Charge

**Combat Style Mastery (11th)**: Trample

##### PISCATOR STYLE

Wielding a net in one hand and a melee weapon (typically a trident) in the other, a ranger trained in the piscator style attempts to entangle or trip his foes before striking in melee. Many masters of this style take Power Attack to deal more damage after successfully tripping a foe. Although originated by the sahuagin, rangers of other aquatic races, as well as coastal fishers and even some gladiators, have adopted this style.

**Combat Style (2nd)**: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net)

**Improved Combat Style (6th)**: Improved Trip

**Combat Style Mastery (11th)**: Improved Critical

##### STRONG-ARM STYLE

The ranger using the strong-arm style wades into battle wielding the largest weapon she can. She relies on strength and the weight of steel to break through her opponent's defenses. Feats such as Great Fortitude, Toughness, and those from the Power Attack feat tree augment this combat style. Many rangers who utilize this style come from nomadic tribal cultures.

**Combat Style (2nd)**: Power Attack

**Improved Combat Style (6th)**: Improved Sunder

**Combat Style Mastery (11th)**: Great Cleave

##### THROWING STYLE

The bow isn't the only ranged weapon favored by rangers; halflings have developed their own ranged combat style that employs their favorite ranged weapons - those they can throw. This style has found favor with some nomadic humans and barbaric humanoids. Like the archery style, practitioners of the throwing style try to maintain distance from opponents. Most take additional feats from the Point Blank Shot feat tree. Clever rangers also use this style to toss holy water vials at undead, acid vials and alchemist's fire at trolls, and tanglefoot bags at those they wish to capture.

**Combat Style (2nd)**: Quick Draw

**Improved Combat Style (6th)**: Point Blank Shot

**Combat Style Mastery (11th)**: Far Shot

#### Crowd-Walker

Certain individuals are comfortable among the throngs of citizens in even the most densely packed city. They know how to maneuver deftly through such environs without impediment.

**Class**: Druid or ranger.

**Level**: 2nd (druid) or 7th (ranger).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain woodland stride.

**Benefit**: When moving through a crowd, the crowd-walker moves at her normal rate, rather than requiring two squares of movement for every square as is normal. In addition, light debris does not impede her movement, and she treats heavy debris as light debris. Any other sort of rough terrain impedes her normally, however.

#### Dead Levels

The ranger has five dead levels, the first of which occurs at 12th level. Their favored enemy bonuses follow a logical progression (one every five levels) if you imagine the 1st favored enemy ability to be granted during a conceptual "0" level for apprentices. Rangers consistently gain new spells per day during all of their dead levels, and so their dead level abilities augment the minor aspects of what rangers are already good at doing.

**Woodland Hunter (Ex)**: At 12th level, a ranger can make "get along in the wild" checks while moving at his full overland speed. See [[Survival]].

**Perceptive Tracker (Ex)**: At 14th level, a ranger never takes longer than a full-round action to find tracks with a Survival check. A second roll is still required to follow any discovered tracks.

**Seasoned Explorer (Ex)**: At 16th level, a ranger can make Survival checks to gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving at his full overland speed. See [[Survival]].

**Instinctive Tracker (Ex)**: At 18th level, a ranger takes a standard action to find tracks with a Survival check, allowing the character to simultaneously move at his speed.

**Survivalist (Ex)**: At 19th level, the ranger becomes so certain in the use of Survival that the character can use it reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a skill check with Survival, the ranger may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent the character from doing so.



#### Distracting Attack

A ranger's animal companion isn't nearly as tough as a druid's, and thus works best as a scout or occasional flanker in combat. If your ranger would prefer to avoid the hassle of taking care of an animal companion, you can get some of the same benefit with the distracting attack alternative class feature. Though not as effective as an actual flanker, the ability to spread out your attacks to affect multiple enemies is a nice side effect.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion.

**Benefit**: Beginning at 4th level, whenever you hit an enemy with a weapon attack (whether melee or ranged), that enemy is considered flanked by you for the purpose of adjudicating your allies' attacks. For example, if your rogue ally attacked that enemy, not only would she gain a +2 bonus on her melee attack roll but she could also add her sneak attack damage to a successful melee attack.

This flanked condition lasts until either the enemy is attacked by one of your allies or until the start of your next turn, whichever comes first. This is an extraordinary ability.

This ability has no effect on creatures that can't be flanked.

#### Elf Ranger

The elf ranger combines sylvan grace with deadly skill, moving effortlessly through the wilds in search of his prey. He isn't quite as tough as a typical ranger but enjoys extra bonuses against his race's favored enemies and can befriend a powerful elven hound.

**Hit Die**: d6.

##### Requirements

To take an elf ranger substitution level, a character must be an elf about to take his 1st, 4th, or 10th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Elf ranger substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard ranger class, plus Balance.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Elf Ranger Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+2|+0|Elf favored enemy, Track, wild empathy|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Elven hound companion|Same as ranger|
|10th|+10/+5|+7|+7|+3|Strongheart slayer|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the elf ranger's racial substitution levels.

**Elf Favored Enemy (Ex)**: An elf ranger's favored enemy ability grants him a +2 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks used against creatures of the chosen type, and a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. If the elf ranger chooses humanoid (orc), undead, or "servants of Lolth" as his favored enemy, these bonuses rise to +3. "Servants of Lolth" includes drow, monstrous spiders of all sizes, and driders; this is an addition to the [[normal list]] of options for a ranger's favored enemy.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger's 1st-level favored enemy class feature.

This substitution feature also affects the elf ranger's later improvements to his favored enemy ability. Each time an elf ranger gains a new favored enemy, he can increase the bonus for one favored enemy by 2, or by 3 if he chooses to increase his bonus against orcs, undead, or the servants of Lolth.

**Elven Hound Companion (Ex)**: A 4th-level elf ranger can select an elven hound as his animal companion, even though the creature is a magical beast. For the purpose of any of the ranger's spells that affect animals, as well as his use of Handle Animal or wild empathy on the companion, the elven hound is treated as an animal.

**Strongheart Slayer (Ex)**: A 10th-level elf ranger gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against the spells and spell-like abilities of drow and driders, and a +4 morale bonus on Fortitude saves against the poison of monstrous spiders.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger's 10th-level third favored enemy class feature, as well as the additional +2 (or +3) bonus against an existing favored enemy. The elf ranger instead gains his third favored enemy at 15th level.



#### Fangshields Ranger

Rangers of the Fangshields use their skills to patrol the wildlands, as well as to spy on and hunt evil creatures. However, some of the standard ranger class features are useless to creatures that lack hands to use manufactured weapons. Fangshields rangers learn other abilities to take advantage of their nonhumanoid anatomy, helping them become dangerous leaders of beasts and animals.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Fangshields ranger substitution level, a character must be a nonhumanoid creature, be a member of the Fangshields, have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 2nd, 4th, or 5th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Fangshields ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus Diplomacy.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Fangshields ranger substitution levels.

**Combat Style (Ex)**: Often lacking hands, Fangshields rangers have a third option for their combat style: natural attacks. If a ranger selects this combat style, at 2nd level he gains Multiattack (if he has more than one kind of natural attack) or Improved Natural Attack (if he has only one kind of natural attack) as a bonus feat.

At 6th level, a ranger with this combat style gains Weapon Focus for any one of his natural attack types. At 11th level, a ranger with this combat option gains Weapon Focus for a second of his natural weapons, or Greater Weapon Focus for his natural weapon if he has only one kind.

A Fangshields ranger need not meet any of the normal prerequisites for these bonus feats.

**Animal Companion (Ex)**: A Fangshields ranger uses the normal ranger animal companion rules, but because he is beastlike himself, he has a stronger bond with the animal. The ranger's effective druid level is treated as one-half his ranger level +2.

**Lion and the [[Unicorn]] (Ex)**: At 5th level, a Fangshields ranger chooses an affinity for Nobanion or Lurue, even if he already has a patron deity (this doesn't cause a religious conflict). If he chooses Nobanion, he gets a +1 sacred bonus to AC during the day; if he chooses Lurue, he gets a +1 sacred bonus to AC during the night. He gets the benefit of this ability whether or not he is outside or knows the time of day. This ability doesn't apply on a plane other than the Material Plane.

This benefit replaces the second favored enemy class feature gained by a standard ranger at 5th level.

  

**Table: Fangshields Ranger Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+2|+3|+3|+0|Combat style|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Animal companion|Same as ranger|
|5th|+5|+4|+4|+1|Lion and the [[Unicorn]]|Same as ranger|

  

#### Favored Environment

Instead of selecting a type of creature against which to apply a bonus on certain skills and damage rolls, the ranger selects a specific natural environment and gains bonuses when in that environment.

At 1st level, a ranger may select a natural environment from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Environments. Due to the ranger's experience in that environment, he gains a +2 bonus on [[Hide]], [[Listen]], [[Move Silently]], [[Spot]], and [[Survival]] checks when using these skills in that environment. He also gains the same bonus on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature) checks made in association with that environment (or on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) checks made in association with underground environments, if the ranger has selected underground as a favored environment).

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (at 10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored environment from those given on the table and gains an identical bonus on the appropriate skill checks in that environment. In addition, at each such interval, the bonuses in any one favored environment (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored environments. In one he has a +4 bonus on the appropriate skill checks, and in the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored environments, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to any of his three favored environments. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, and +2 or +6,+2, and +2.

If the ranger chooses desert or forest, he must also choose a climate type, as indicated on the table (either "cold" or "temperate or warm" for desert, or "cold or temperate" or "warm" for forest).

The game master may rule that a ranger can't select an environment that he has never visited.

**Table: Ranger Favored Environments**

|Environment|Examples|
|:--|:--|
|Aquatic|Sea, ocean (on or under water)|
|Desert| cold|Tundra|
|Desert| temperate or warm|Badlands, sandy desert|
|Forest| cold or temperate|Forest|
|Forest| warm|Jungle|
|Hills|Rugged terrain up to 2,000 feet elevation|
|Marsh|Bog, moor, swamp|
|Mountain|Rugged terrain above 2,000 feet elevation|
|Plains|Farmland, grassland, steppe, prairie|
|Underground|Dungeons, caverns|

#### Feign Death

A clever villain has many contingencies in place, so that if a plan goes awry, he can beat a hasty retreat. In exchange for some ability to evade damage, he can enter a state that is indistinguishable from death.

**Class**: Monk, ranger, or rogue.

**Level**: 2nd (monk or rogue) or 9th (ranger).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability. If your class would grant you improved evasion at a higher level, you instead gain evasion.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can enter a catatonic state in which you appear to be dead. While feigning death, you cannot see or feel anything, but you retain the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around you.

While under the effect of this ability, you are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate you, such as [[raise dead]] or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and [[true resurrection]] immediately end your feign death ability.

Spells and other effects that assess your current condition, such as status and [[deathwatch]], indicate that you are dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) can discern that you are actually alive.

You can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though you still require food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.

#### Gnome Ranger

Hampered to some extent by her size, the gnome ranger learns to play off her other strengths. By embracing her connection to burrowing animals, the gnome ranger can attract an animal companion that can support her in combat. Against her favored enemies, she favors tactics of stealth more than interaction, and she truly shines when she chooses the traditional foes of her race as favored enemies. Her magic likewise draws on her racial abilities, allowing her to cast illusions unavailable to most rangers. The combination of these abilities makes the gnome ranger a fearsome ambusher who fights with the ferocity of the [[badger]].

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a gnome ranger substitution level, a character must be a gnome about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Gnome ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Gnome Ranger Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+2|+0|Gnome favored enemy, Track, wild empathy|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Burrowing animal companion|Same as ranger|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+6|+2|Gnome ranger spells|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the gnome ranger's racial substitution levels.

**Gnome Favored Enemy (Ex)**: A gnome ranger who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: [[#Ranger Favored Enemies]]. Due to her extensive study of her chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, she gains a +2 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. If the gnome ranger chooses humanoid (goblinoid), humanoid (reptilian), or giant as her favored enemy, both bonuses rise to +3.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example a 5th-level gnome ranger has two favored enemies; against one she gains a +4 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other she has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, she has three favored enemies, and she gains an additional +2 bonus, which she can allocate to the bonus against any one of her three favored enemies. Thus her bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the gnome ranger selected humanoid (goblinoid), humanoid (reptilian), or giant as one of her favored enemies, the bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls increases by 3 instead of 2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, she must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on Table: [[#Ranger Favored Enemies]]. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger's bonuses do not stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

This benefit replaces the standard ranger's 1st-level favored enemy class feature.

**Burrowing Animal Companion (Ex)**: If a gnome ranger takes the 4th-level racial substitution level and chooses a [[badger]], [[Badger_Dire|dire badger]], or wolverine as her animal companion (or any other mammalian animal with a burrowing speed), her effective druid level equals 1/2 her ranger level +3, instead of 1/2 her ranger level. (If she chooses a [[Badger_Dire|dire badger]] or a wolverine, her effective druid level is still reduced by 3, per the [[druid#Alternative Animal Companions|Alternative Animal Companions]] table.) In addition, she can use her racial [[speak with animals]] ability to speak with her animal companion at will.

This benefit replaces the standard ranger's ability to share spells with her animal companion.

**Gnome Ranger Spells**: A gnome ranger who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level adds [[blur]], invisibility, and misdirection to the list of 2nd-level ranger spells she can prepare and cast. These spells replace [[barkskin]], snare, and [[wind wall]] on the ranger spell list.

Although she cannot cast them yet, she also adds [[Invisibility Greater|greater invisibility]] and [[phantasmal killer]] to her list of 4th-level ranger spells. These spells replace [[commune with nature]] and [[tree stride]] on the ranger spell list.

#### Golarion Ranger

Rangers who join a military unit sometimes focus their training on a single animal, to the exclusion of all others, forming a tight bond. This ability replaces the wild empathy ability.

**Enhanced Companion (Ex)**: Upon gaining an animal companion at 4th level, the ranger must choose a single type of animal. The ranger cannot call a different animal companion. The ranger's effective druid level is equal to the ranger's level -2 (instead of the normal 1/2) for that type of animal. This animal must be on the basic list of companions that can be chosen at 4th level and cannot be changed.



#### Half-Elf Ranger

Not all rangers spend their entire lives in the untamed wilds of the forests and hills. Some half-elves find a mix of rural and urban life to their taste, and temper their wilderness lore with the ability to interact well with a wide range of individuals. The half-elf ranger is the ultimate investigator and bounty hunter. She finds social skills just as important for survival as fighting prowess.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a half-elf ranger substitution level, a character must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 4th, or 13th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Half-elf ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class, plus Gather Information and Speak Language.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the half-elf ranger racial substitution levels.

**Urban Tracking (Ex)**: The half-elf ranger gains Urban Tracking as a bonus feat.

An 8th-level ranger with Urban Tracking can cut the time required per Gather Information check to 30 minutes without taking the normal -5 penalty on the check. (This benefit augments, but does not replace, the standard 8thlevel ranger class feature of swift tracker.)

This benefit replaces the Track feat normally gained as a bonus feat by a standard 1st-level ranger.

**Street Magic**: At 4th level, a half-elf ranger adds the following spells to her class spell list: 1st - [[comprehend languages]], [[detect secret doors]], message; 2nd - [[detect thoughts]], [[tongues]]; 3rd - [[phantom steed]]; 4th - [[dimension door]].

A ranger who selects this substitution feature loses the following spells from her class spell list: 1st - [[detect animals or plants]], [[detect snares and pits]], entangle, [[Summon Natures Ally I|summon nature's ally I]]; 2nd - snare, [[speak with plants]], [[Summon Natures Ally II|summon nature's ally II]]; 3rd - [[command plants]], [[diminish plants]], [[plant growth]], [[Summon Natures Ally II|summon nature's ally II]], [[tree shape]]; 4th - [[commune with nature]], [[Summon Natures Ally IV|summon nature's ally IV]], [[tree stride]].

**Skill Mastery (Ex)**: At 13th level, a half-elf ranger becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.

This benefit replaces the standard ranger's camouflage ability.

  

**Table: Half-Elf Ranger Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+2|+0|1st Favored enemy, Urban Tracking, wild empathy|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Animal companion, street magic|Same as ranger|
|13th|+13/+8/+3|+8|+8|+4|Skill mastery|Same as ranger|

  

#### Hidden Stalker

For those who know how to use them, the ever-shifting concealment of the throng and the back alleys of the city provide just as much opportunity for stealth as the shadows of the trees or the early morning fog.

**Class**: Ranger or scout.

**Level**: 13th (ranger) or 8th (scout).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the camouflage ability, and your hide in plain sight ability (gained at higher levels) is modified.

**Benefit**: Upon first gaining this ability, the hidden stalker no longer takes a -5 penalty on Hide checks when moving faster than half speed, nor does she take the standard -10 penalty when attempting to hide during a brief distraction. In addition, the presence of other people within 5 feet is considered sufficient cover for her to hide, making it easy for her to vanish into a crowd.

At the second level of this ability, the hidden stalker gains hide in plain sight, but this ability functions in any urban environment, rather than only in natural environments as written.

#### Kobold Ranger

Kobold rangers are not deterred by their size, forging lifelong relationships with their preferred dire weasel companions, who more than make up for their masters' physical shortcomings. A kobold ranger is a sentinel for her tribe, riding the fringes of her lands in search of enemies and threats. Nothing slows a kobold ranger in pursuit of prey.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a kobold ranger substitution level, a character must be a kobold about to take her 1st, 4th, or 7th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Kobold ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Kobold Ranger Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+2|+0|Kobold favored enemy, Track, wild empathy|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Dire weasel companion, kobold ranger spells|Same as ranger|
|7th|+7/+2|+5|+5|+2|Subterranean stride|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All the following are class features of the kobold ranger racial substitution levels.

**Kobold Favored Enemy (Ex)**: A kobold ranger who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains the normal ranger favored enemy bonus on checks and damage rolls, but the skills affected by the bonus are Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival instead of those given for the standard ranger.

If a kobold ranger selects fey, humanoid (dwarf), or humanoid (gnome) as her favored enemy, she gains a +3 bonus against the chosen creature type instead of the standard +2. Bonuses against such creatures also increase by 3 every time the kobold ranger gains a new favored enemy, instead of the standard +2 increase.

This substitution feature replaces but is otherwise identical to the standard ranger's favored enemy class feature (PH 47).

**Dire Weasel Companion (Ex)**: A kobold ranger who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains a dire weasel animal companion. This ability functions like the druid's animal companion ability, treating the kobold ranger's effective druid level as half her ranger level, instead of half her ranger level -3. A kobold ranger cannot select from an alternative list of animal companions; she is restricted to choosing a dire weasel as her animal companion.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger's animal companion class feature.

**Kobold Ranger Spells**: A kobold ranger who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level replaces certain spells on her ranger spell list with kobold alternatives. For 1st-level ranger spells, steal size replaces entangle. A kobold ranger also exchanges the 2nd-level ranger spells [[speak with plants]] and [[spike growth]] for local tremor and [[soften earth and stone]]. She replaces the 3rd-level ranger spells [[command plants]], [[diminish plants]], [[plant growth]], and [[tree shape]] with [[meld into stone]], [[spike stones]], [[stone shape]], and [[stoneskin]]. [[Stone tell]] replaces the 4th-level ranger spell [[tree stride]].

**Subterranean Stride (Ex)**: A kobold ranger who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level can move across dense rubble or natural stone floors at her normal speed, ignoring any effects related to terrain (DMG 60). However, a rock surface that is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affects her.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger's woodland stride class feature.

#### Moon-Warded Ranger

Moon-warded rangers call upon the essence of the moon to defend themselves. By forgoing attack capabilities normally afforded by the ranger class, the moon-warded ranger gains access to special defensive bonuses. This variant ranger gains all the class features of the standard ranger, except as noted.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a moon-warded ranger substitution level, a character must worship the moon and be about to take her 2nd, 6th, or 11th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Moon-warded ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Moon-Warded Ranger Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2nd|+2|+3|+3|+0|Armor of the senses|—|
|6th|+6/+1|+5|+5|+2|Skin of the moon|Same as ranger|
|11th|+11/+6/+1|+7|+7|+3|Indomitable mind|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the moon-warded ranger's substitution levels.

**Armor of the Senses (Su)**: At 2nd level, a moon-warded ranger adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. This bonus only applies when the ranger wears light armor or no armor. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks and when the ranger is flat-footed. She loses this bonus when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor greater than light, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

This ability replaces the standard ranger's combat style ability.

**Skin of the Moon (Su)**: At 6th level, a moon-warded ranger gains damage reduction 2/- at night, regardless of whether or not the moon is visible. This damage reduction increases to 3/- under the unobscurred light of the moon. This ability stacks with damage reduction of the same type from other sources (such as a barbarian's DR).

This ability replaces the standard ranger's improved combat style ability.

**Indomitable Mind (Su)**: At 11th level, a moon-warded ranger gains immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities, with the exception of harmless mind-affecting spells and abilities (such as bless and heroism).

This ability replaces the standard ranger's combat style mastery ability.

#### Mystic Ranger

Mystic rangers combine fighting prowess, wilderness survival skills, and magical abilities - like standard rangers. However, a mystic ranger spends more time in prayer and meditation, and is well attuned to the spiritual side of his discipline. Hence, this form of ranger gains spell abilities much sooner, and is able to wield them more effectively than the standard ranger class. In consequence their more combat-oriented abilities are weaker and are learned later.

The mystic ranger is a variant ranger. Unless otherwise noted, a mystic ranger advances in the same manner as a ranger (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of ranger or mystic ranger, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level ranger twice.

**Alignment**: Any non-evil.

##### Class Skills

Spellcraft is a class skill for mystic rangers.

**Table: The Mystic Ranger**

|20th|+20/+15/+10/+5|+12|+12|+6|4th favored enemy|5|5|5|5|4|4|

##### Class Features

The mystic ranger gains Endurance and his combat style abilities later than the ranger, and gives up the ability to gain an animal companion.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A mystic ranger is proficient with all simple weapons, martial ranged weapons, and light armor. A mystic ranger is not proficient with martial melee weapons or shields.

**Spell List**: The mystic ranger casts 1st-through 4th-level spells from the ranger spell list. His 0-level spell list consists of [[create water]], [[cure minor wounds]], [[flare]], guidance, [[know direction]], light, [[mending]], [[purify food and drink]], resistance, and [[virtue]]. His 5th-level list consists of [[awaken]], [[baleful polymorph]], [[cure critical wounds]], [[control winds]], [[Summon Natures Ally V|summon nature's ally V]], and [[wall of thorns]].

#### Natural Born Ranger

Culture often exerts as strong a pull upon young people as their lineage. Acquiring likes, loathings, special talents, and important insights at their parent's knee, a body of lore comes to them almost as a birthright. A few, however, follow their own unique paths. They take other ways, scorning the lessons so eagerly sought by their playmates in favor of what they teach themselves. These atypical members of the different races usually band together. Although too rare or new to be true subraces, it is groups such as these that eventually interbreed and develop into their own subsets of the common races. All of the racial traits presented here focus on characters who begin play at 1st level as rangers, so these alternative racial traits might not work well in a world where the standard races already have "wild" subraces. Given a few generations, however, those with these new racial traits might easily interbreed to such an extent that they form wild subraces.

These new racial traits require a character to begin play as a ranger and to give up one or more standard racial traits. As elves and half-orcs lack (or have very few) racial traits based on their cultures, they gain compensating drawbacks instead of losing traits they already have.

Because these alternative rules fundamentally alter the way races work, a DM is encouraged to have a careful and thorough understanding of these racial traits before allowing them in her campaign.

##### Dwarf Ranger

The forge. The chisel. They held little appeal. When others talked of battles with giants you paid scant attention, already hatching strategies to help you face what you saw as the true threat.

These dwarf rangers lose stonecunning, their bonuses on Appraise and Craft checks, and their dodge bonus to AC against giants. In exchange, they gain a dodge bonus to AC against their favored enemies equal to half their bonuses on damage and skill checks. For instance, a dwarf ranger who has a +4 favored enemy bonus against aberrations gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC whenever he faces an aberration.

##### Elf Ranger

Even as a child you knew that your homeland was a marvelous, special place, its inhabitants blessed by the deities and deserving of your protection. Nothing drives you to greater passion than coming face to face with interlopers bent upon despoiling it.

These elven rangers gain a particular affinity for the terrain of their homelands. Choose a terrain: aquatic, desert, forest, hills, marsh, mountain, or plains. The elf ranger gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made while in that terrain. Outside of that terrain, however, the elf ranger's unfamiliarity imposes a -1 penalty on Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.

##### Gnome Ranger

The others laughed and played their pranks, but you always took life more seriously. Life was dangerous, dirty, and hard, and as your innate magic developed you discovered more sensible uses than practical jokes.

These gnome rangers retain their ability to cast [[speak with animals]] but lose their other spell-like abilities in order to cast [[create water]], [[detect poison]] and [[purify food and drink]] once per day. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's Charisma modifier + spell level.

##### Half-Elf Ranger

Strangers made you uncomfortable, always staring and asking rude questions. You kept your distance. Eventually you learned to find refuge in the wilds and fellowship with the creatures that lived there.

These half-elf rangers lose their +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks, gaining in exchange a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Hide checks.

##### Half-Orc Ranger

Outcast! Outsider! Your blood is tainted, surviving only on hatred and raw determination, you renounced half of your background and vowed bloody vengeance.

These half-orc rangers gain a particular hatred and disdain for one side of their heritage. A half-orc ranger may select an additional favored enemy at 1st level, choosing either humanoid (human) or humanoid (orc) and gaining a +2 bonus on damage rolls and certain skill checks as normal. The half-orc ranger cannot also select humanoid (human) or humanoid (orc) as his 1st-level favored enemy. As he advances in levels he may increase this bonus like any other favored enemy. However, his instinctive loathing and revulsion for this part of his parentage imposes a penalty on all Charisma checks and skills equal to his favored enemy bonus when dealing with members of the race he despises.

##### Halfling Ranger

The others trusted in fate, secure in their beliefs that their deities would protect them from harm. You knew too much about the evils that surrounded you to rely upon faith and devoted yourself to preparing for the battles to come.

These halfling rangers lose their +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. In exchange, they gain a bonus on saving throws and opposed skill checks versus their favored enemies equal to half their bonus on damage and skill checks made against these enemies.

#### Phynxkin Companion

A druid or ranger who adventures in regions rich with draconic influence can gain an alternative animal companion, a phynxkin, that serves him as loyally as any other animal companion would.

**Class**: Druid or ranger.

**Level**: 1st (druid) or 4th (ranger).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you give up your standard choice of animal companion, and your animal companion does not gain all benefits normally accorded to it (see below).

**Benefit**: You gain a phynxkin as an animal companion. Treat it as an animal for the purpose of determining the effects of your skills, feats, spells, and other abilities.

When your phynxkin would normally gain the devotion special quality, both you and the phynxkin instead gain immunity to fear effects, but only while you are within 30 feet of each other.

When your effective druid level for determining your animal companion's abilities reaches 7th, you can replace your animal companion with a dire phynxkin animal companion. Doing this reduces your effective druid level for determining its abilities by six.

#### Planar Ranger

Rangers from the Material Plane stalk and protect forests and hills, and the same is true for rangers who live on other planes. Of course, they may be crystal forests and hills of flame, but the deep personal connection and dedication remain exactly the same.

Whatever the nature of a planar ranger's chosen home, he is as comfortable there as a noble is upon his throne. He can sense trouble on the wind, glean details of recent events from a single footprint, and know the habits of the local f lora and fauna the way a mother bear knows her cubs.

**Hit Die**: d8.

To take a ranger planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 4th, 8th, or 13th level of ranger.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

##### Class Skills

Ranger planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Ranger Planar Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Planar animal companion|Same as ranger|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+6|+2|Portal intuition|Same as ranger|
|13th|+13/+8/+3|+8|+8|+4|Planar tracking|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the ranger's planar substitution levels.

**Planar Animal Companion (Ex)**: At 4th level, a planar ranger can select a celestial or fiendish animal as his animal companion. Doing this reduces the ranger's effective druid level by one.

For example, a 4th-level planar ranger (with an effective druid level of 1st) can select an animal from the normal list of potential companions. When he reaches 8th level, that companion would gain the bonus Hit Dice and other special abilities granted to the animal companion of a 3rd-level druid. He can't select a celestial leopard or fiendish wolverine until he reaches 10th level (effective druid level 4th).

Unlike a typical animal companion, the planar animal companion is a magical beast. However, the ranger (and only the ranger) can still affect it with his spells as if it were an animal.

To gain a celestial companion, a ranger must have a nonevil alignment. To gain a fiendish companion, a ranger must have a nongood alignment. If the ranger's alignment changes to one that is ineligible for the companion, the companion either turns on the ranger or leaves at its earliest convenience, depending on its natural tendencies.

**Portal Intuition (Ex)**: At 8th level, a planar ranger becomes an expert at tracking quarry across planes and through various portals and breaches. When examining a portal, the ranger may attempt to determine to which plane the portal leads. To do this, he must succeed on both a DC 20 Survival check and a DC 20 [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) check.

The ranger can also use this ability to determine whether or not a planar breach occurred within 20 feet of a particular spot within the last 24 hours. To do this, he must succeed on a DC 20 Search check. If the ranger determines that a breach did occur in the area, he may then use this ability to ascertain where it led.

This benefit replaces the swift tracker class feature gained by a standard ranger at 8th level.

**Planar Tracking (Sp)**: Once per day, a ranger who chooses this substitution benefit can use [[plane shift]] as a spell-like ability (with a caster level equal to his class level) in order to follow his quarry. He must be tracking a favored enemy, and he must be at the spot where the creature traveled from one plane to another.

Unlike with the [[plane shift]] spell, the ranger has no chance of deviation from the intended destination. He and anyone he brings with him arrives in the exact spot that his quarry did. Spells that prevent planar travel (such as [[dimensional lock]]) affect this ability as they would any casting of [[plane shift]].

The ranger does not automatically pick up his quarry's trail when he arrives on the new plane. He must use his Track feat to find the creature's tracks and pick up the hunt. But he has the advantage of knowing that his target definitely passed that way.

This benefit replaces the camouflage class feature gained by a standard ranger at 13th level.

#### Planewalker Ranger

The planewalker ranger roams the multiverse instead of the wilderness, learning the secrets of the planes.

##### Class Skills

Eliminate [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature) and [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) from the ranger's class skill list.

Add [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (the planes) and [[Speak Language]] (Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, Terran only) to the class skill list.

##### Class Features

The planewalker ranger has all the standard ranger class features, except as noted below.

**Wild Empathy**: A planewalker ranger takes no penalty on wild empathy checks made to influence magical beasts with the [[celestial]] or [[fiendish]] templates. However, he takes a -4 penalty when using this ability against animals.

**Animal Companion**: A nonevil planewalker ranger may have a [[celestial]] version of a normal [[animal]] as his animal companion. A nongood planewalker ranger may have a [[fiendish]] version of a normal animal as his animal companion.

**Spellcasting**: A planewalker ranger's spellcasting ability is largely unchanged from that of the standard ranger, with one exception: Any ranger spell that normally affects animals also affects [[celestial]] or [[fiendish]] versions of animals when cast by a planewalker ranger.

#### Predator

A ranger might forgo training in weapon combat in exchange for the ability to take animal form and move swiftly through the woodlands.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class's features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

**Lose**: Combat style, improved combat style, combat style mastery.

**Gain**: Wild shape (as [[druid]]; Small or Medium animals only), fast movement (as [[Barbarian]]).

#### Rival Organization

A few urban rangers, devoted to a particular organization, guild, or church, prefer to focus their studies and their efforts against a rival group, instead of a specific race.

**Class**: Ranger.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain favored enemy or any later improvements to that class feature.

**Benefit**: At 1st level, the ranger chooses one particular organization that he has studied in depth. This could be a guild, a noble house, a church, or any similar specifically defined entity. (See Politics and Power for definitions and samples of these groups.) Due to his [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] of how the organization operates, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Gather Information, [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local), and Sense Motive checks made against, or pertaining to, members of that organization. Likewise, due to his heightened awareness around these individuals, he gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class against members of this group.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional rival organization. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one rival organization (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

#### Shadow Sword

Rangers of the Knights of the Shadow Sword patrol Myth Drannor and attempt to rid it of the evils living there. They use their stealth and spell-power to aid the fighters of their order.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Shadow Sword substitution level, a character must have Shaundakul as his patron, be a member of the Knights of the Shadow Sword, have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take his 3rd, 6th, or 8th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Shadow Sword substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (history).

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Shadow Sword Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3rd|+3|+3|+3|+1|Walk in silence|—|
|6th|+6/+1|+5|+5|+2|Bane weapon|Same as ranger|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+6|+2|Portal analysis|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Shadow Sword substitution levels.

**Walk in Silence (Su)**: At 3rd level, a Shadow Sword gains the ability to move with amazing silence, receiving a +5 circumstance bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 round. The ranger activates this ability with a swift action and can use it a number of times per day equal to one-half his ranger level. This ability only functions if the ranger is wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load.

This benefit replaces the Endurance bonus feat gained by a standard ranger at 3rd level.

**Bane Weapon (Su)**: At 6th level, a Shadow Sword learns how to temporarily turn any weapon he wields into a [[bane]] weapon. Activating this ability requires a full-round action, at which point the ranger must choose the type (and subtype, if appropriate) of creature against which the bane special ability will apply. This choice must match a creature type (and subtype) of one of the ranger's favored enemies. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to one-half the ranger's class level, and can be used a number of times per day equal to one + his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1/day). The bane ability only functions while the weapon is in the ranger's hands. The ranger can have no more than one weapon affected by this class feature at any time, nor can any weapon benefit from more than one application of this class feature (in either case, a second use immediately ends any previous effect).

This benefit replaces the improved combat style class feature normally gained at 6th level. If a Shadow Sword ranger later gains combat style mastery, he instead gains improved combat style.

**Portal Analysis (Su)**: At 8th level, a Shadow Sword gains the ability to sense portals and manipulate them in strange ways. He automatically detects any portal within 10 feet and can thereafter study any portal within 10 feet as if using analyze portal. If he is able to activate the portal, once per day the Shadow Sword can enter it as if using the portal well spell.

This benefit replaces the swift tracker class feature gained by a standard ranger at 8th level.

#### Shifter Ranger

Many shifters become rangers, both from their love of the ranger's solitude and single-minded purpose, and from their inherent connection to the natural world. Racial substitution levels allow the shifter ranger to enjoy an even stronger bond with the wilderness, enhancing his own shifting abilities and even sharing them with his animal companion.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a shifter ranger substitution level, a character must be a shifter about to take his 1st, 4th, or 9th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Shifter ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class, plus Balance.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

  

**Table: Shifter Ranger Racial Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|+1|+2|+2|+0|1st favored enemy, Track, wild empathy|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Animal companion, share shifting|Same as ranger|
|9th|+9/+4|+6|+6|+3|Enhanced shifting|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All the following are features of the shifter ranger's racial substitution levels.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)**: Beginning at 1st level, a shifter ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions identically to the druid class feature of the same name, except that the shifter ranger's innate understanding of the natural world allows him to add his Wisdom modifier (instead of his Charisma modifier) to his wild empathy checks.

**Share Shifting (Su)**: A shifter ranger of 4th level or higher can share the benefits he gains while shifting with his animal companion. The companion must be adjacent to the ranger when he begins shifting (though any distance between them has no subsequent effect). All shared benefits end when the ranger's shifting ends (or if he loses consciousness).

The animal companion gains all the benefits of shifting (including any shifter feats or class features in effect for the shifter ranger), though it does not gain any new natural weapons. If it already has a natural weapon that the shifter ranger gains while shifting, it gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls for every four of the ranger's class levels.

This substitution feature replaces a standard ranger's ability to share spells with his animal companion.

**Enhanced Shifting (Su)**: A 9th-level shifter ranger gains an extra benefit while shifting, based on his primary shifter trait (the trait chosen during character creation, and the one that provides a bonus to his ability score).

If the shifter's primary trait grants a bonus to Strength, the shifter's natural weapons are treated as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction while shifting. This benefit applies to the gorebrute, longtooth, and razorclaw traits.

If the shifter's primary trait grants a bonus to Dexterity, the shifter gains improved evasion, avoiding damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save and taking only half damage on a failed save (see the [[monk]] class feature). This benefit applies to the cliffwalk, longstride, and swiftwing traits.

If the shifter's primary trait grants a bonus to Constitution, the shifter gains fast healing while shifting, gaining a number of hit points per round equal to 1 + the number of shifter feats he possesses. See [[Fast Healing]] for details, but note that this ability doesn't stack with any other fast healing the shifter might possess. This benefit applies to the beasthide, truedive, and wildhunt traits.

If the shifter's primary trait grants a bonus to Wisdom, the shifter gains immunity to enchantment effects while shifting. This benefit applies to the dreamsight trait.

This substitution feature replaces a standard ranger's evasion ability.

#### Shooting Star

Rangers of the Order of the Shooting Star (see Knights of the Mystic Fire) serve Mystra by scouting, spying, and dealing with fiends and monstrosities created by magical experimentation.

**Hit Die**: d8.

##### Requirements

To take a Shooting Star substitution level, a character must have Mystra as her patron deity, be a member of the Order of the Shooting Star, have 1 rank in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 4th, or 8th level of ranger.

##### Class Skills

Shooting Star substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) and Spellcraft.

**Skill Points at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  

**Table: Shooting Star Substitution Levels**

|Level|Base  <br>Attack Bonus|Fort  <br>Save|Ref  <br>Save|Will  <br>Save|Special|Spellcasting|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|3rd|+3|+3|+3|+1|Weavespeak|—|
|4th|+4|+4|+4|+1|Bonus spells, improved spellcasting|Same as ranger|
|8th|+8/+3|+6|+6|+2|Bonus spells, expanded spell list|Same as ranger|
|11th|+11/+6/+1|+7|+7|+3|Bonus spells, combat style mastery|Same as ranger|
|14th|+14/+9/+4|+9|+9|+4|Bonus spells|Same as ranger|

##### Class Features

All of the following are features of the Shooting Star ranger substitution levels.

**Weavespeak (Sp)**: Because the members of this order need to report their findings over long distances, starting at 3rd level a Shooting Star develops the power to use the Weave itself to transmit short messages. Once per day the character can transmit a message of twenty-five words or less to the nearest cleric, paladin, or ranger of Mystra (the Shooting Star can't choose the recipient). This ability only functions where the Weave is active, and it cannot jump planar boundaries; the ranger knows if either condition would prevent the message from reaching its target. It is otherwise the equivalent of a [[sending]] spell.

This benefit replaces the Endurance bonus feat gained by a standard ranger at 3rd level.

**Bonus Spells (Su)**: At 4th level, a Shooting Star gains a bonus 1st-level ranger spell slot as if from a high Wisdom score. At 8th level she gains a bonus 2nd-level ranger spell slot, at 11th level she gains a bonus 3rd-level ranger spell slot, and at 14th level she gains a bonus 4th-level ranger spell slot.

This benefit replaces the animal companion class feature gained by a standard ranger at 4th level.

**Improved Spellcasting (Ex)**: When casting ranger spells, a Shooting Star can treat her caster level as equal to one-half her ranger level +2. If she also has arcane spellcasting ability from another class, she can add her caster level from that class to this value to determine her caster level.

**Expanded Spell List**: At 8th level, a Shooting Star adds [[see invisibility]] (2nd level) and [[word of recall]] (4th level) to her ranger spell list.

This replaces the standard ranger's swift tracker class feature.

#### Skilled City-Dweller

The various wilderness-oriented skills are valuable indeed, but make less sense - and may prove less useful - for an urban character.

**Class**: Any class that has one or more of the "skills replaced," as listed below, on its list of class skills.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the "skills replaced" as listed below.

**Benefit**: The skilled city-dweller gains one or more skills as class skills, at the expense of other skills. If she does not have the proper skill to lose, she cannot gain the skill it grants as an urban benefit.

Note that she need not swap out all these skills. A skilled city-dweller may pick and choose, but she cannot later change her mind.

|Skill Replaced|Skill Gained|
|---|---|
|[[Handle Animal]]|[[Gather Information]]|
|[[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature)|[[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local)|
|[[Survival]]|[[Sense Motive]]|
|[[Ride]]|[[Tumble]]|

  

#### Solitary Hunting

A ranger who loses his faith also loses his most obvious blessing of nature: his animal companion. In return, though, he becomes even more self-reliant.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain your animal companion. If you already have an animal companion. it abandons you immediately.

**Benefit**: Your favored enemy bonus also applies to your attack rolls.

#### Spell Reflection

Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.

**Class**: Monk, ranger, rogue, or scout.

**Level**: 2nd (monk or rogue), 5th (scout), or 9th (ranger).

**Special Requirement**: [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (arcana) 1 rank.

**Replaces**: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)

**Benefit**: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability.

For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a [[scorching ray]], you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the [[scorching ray]] deals its normal damage to the wizard.

This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren't subject to this reflection.

If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as [[scorching ray]] cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard's [[scorching ray]] spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).

#### Spiritual Connection

You learn to speak with the spirits of the wild places. Although this ability does not automatically make such spirits well disposed toward you, it does provide several benefits.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the wild empathy class feature.

**Benefit**: You can use [[speak with animals]] and [[speak with plants]], as the spells (caster level equals your ranger level). You can use any combination of these effects up to three times per day. These are spell-like abilities with caster level equal to your character level.

#### Spiritual Guide

You are befriended by a spiritual guide that speaks to you and aids you as long as you remain in the wilderness.

**Level**: 4th.

**Replaces**: This benefit replaces the animal companion class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain a spiritual guide. As long as you remain in natural surroundings (including underground caverns), this guide is a constant companion. Once you enter any civilized area larger than a hamlet, however, your spiritual guide leaves your side, returning only when you return to the wilds.

Although it cannot protect you from harm, your spiritual guide can warn you of impending danger. As long as your spiritual guide is with you, you gain a divine bonus equal to one-quarter your ranger level (rounded down) on Handle Animal, [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature), Listen, Search, Spot, and Survival checks. In addition, you can use [[commune with nature]], as the spell, once per day as a full round action (as a spell-like ability with caster level equals your ranger level). You can also prepare and cast this spell normally from your ranger spell list.


#### Trap Expert

Many rangers journey across the wild lands of the surface, but you are trained to descend deep into the earth.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the Track feat at 1st level or the swift tracker ability at 8th level.

**Benefit**: You gain the [[trapfinding]] ability of the rogue. In addition, you gain Disable Device as a class skill. You can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and you can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps.

#### Urban Companion

The fearsome animal companions who accompany some casters in the wild are indeed a boon in combat, but a hulking wolf or creeping tiger is out of place in an urban environment. Some characters believe that small and subtle is of greater value than massive and mighty.

**Class**: Druid or ranger.

**Level**: 1st (druid) or 4th (ranger).

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion.

**Benefit**: The character gains the companionship of a smaller but far more intelligent creature than she otherwise would have. This is identical to the sorcerer's ability to summon a familiar (PH 52), including all benefits granted and gained by the familiar, except as noted below. Her functional level for determining the abilities of the companion is equal to her druid level or one-half her ranger level.

She does not lose experience points if her urban companion is slain, and she requires only 24 hours to replace one who is lost.

Her urban companion has total hit points equal to 3/4 her own hit points, rather than half as per a familiar.

The urban companion gains the ability to speak with other animals of its kind when she has an effective master level of 1st, rather than 7th.

When she reaches an effective master level of 7th, she can [[speak with animals]] of her companion's kind, as per [[speak with animals]]. This is a supernatural ability that functions constantly, and it requires only a free action to reactivate if somehow dispelled.

#### Urban Ranger

The urban ranger stalks the treacherous streets of the city, relying on his [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] of alleyways and underworld contacts to keep him alive.

##### Class Skills

Eliminate [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature), [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (dungeoneering), and [[Survival]] from the ranger's class skill list. Add [[Gather Information]], [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local), and [[Sense Motive]] to the class skill list.

##### Class Features

The urban ranger has all the standard [[ranger]] class features, except as noted below.

**Animal Companion**: An urban ranger cannot have an animal larger than Medium as his animal companion.

**Urban Tracking**: An urban ranger does not gain the [[Track]] feat at 1st level. Instead, he gains the [[Urban Tracking]] feat (see below), which allows him to use [[Gather Information]] to track down a missing person, suspect, or other individual within a community.

**Wild Empathy**: An urban ranger adds only one-half his class level to wild empathy checks, reflecting his limited connection with the natural world.

**Favored Enemy**: At the game master's discretion, an urban ranger may select an organization instead of a creature type as his favored enemy. For example, a character might select a particular thieves' guild, merchant house, or even the city guard. The favored enemy bonuses would apply to all members of the chosen organization, regardless of their creature type or subtype.

**Spellcasting**: The urban ranger's spell list is different from the standard ranger list. The following spells are eliminated from the urban ranger's spell list: [[animal messenger]], [[charm animal]], [[detect animals or plants]], [[speak with animals]], [[Bears Endurance|bear's endurance]], [[hold animal]], snare, [[speak with plants]], [[command plants]], [[diminish plants]], [[plant growth]], [[reduce animal]], [[tree shape]], [[water walk]], [[commune with nature]], and [[tree stride]].

In exchange, the urban ranger adds the following spells to his class spell list:

1st - [[comprehend languages]], [[detect evil|detect chaos/good/evil/law]], [[detect secret doors]], [[message]];

2nd - [[detect thoughts]], [[eagles splendor|eagle's splendor]], [[knock]], [[locate object]];

3rd - [[discern lies]], [[invisibility]], [[speak with dead]], [[tongues]];

4th - [[dimensional anchor]], [[locate creature]], [[mages faithful hound|mage's faithful hound]], [[true seeing]].

**Woodland Stride**: An urban ranger does not gain this ability.

**Swift Tracker (Ex)**: Beginning at 8th level, am urban ranger may make a [[Gather Information]] check for his [[Urban Tracking]] feat every half hour without taking the normal -5 penalty.

**Camouflage**: An urban ranger does not gain this ability.

**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)**: An urban ranger can use this ability in any area, whether natural terrain or not.



##### URBAN TRACKING [GENERAL]

You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.

**Benefit**: To find the trail of an individual or to follow it for 1 hour requires a [[Gather Information]] check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour of the search, as well as each time the trail becomes difficult to follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town.

The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on the community size and the conditions:

|Community Size|DC|Checks Required|
|---|---|---|
|Thorp, hamlet, or village|5|1d3|
|Small or large town|10|1d4+1|
|Small or large city|15|2d4|
|Metropolis|20|2d4+2|

  

|Conditions|DC Modifier|
|:--|---|
|Every three creatures in the group being sought|-1|
|Every 24 hours party has been missing/sought|+1|
|Tracked party "lies low"|+5|
|Tracked party matches community's  <br>primary racial demographic|+2|
|Tracked party does not match community's  <br>primary, or secondary racial demographic|-2|

If you fail a Gather Information check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning. The game master should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn't know exactly how long the task will require.

**Normal**: A character without this feat can use [[Gather Information]] to find out information about a particular individual, but each check takes 1d4+1 hours and doesn't allow effective trailing.

**Special**: A character with 5 ranks in [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (local) gains a +2 bonus on the [[Gather Information]] check to use this feat.

You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (to 30 minutes per check rather than 1 hour), but you take a -5 penalty on the check.

#### Urban Tracker

Many rangers of the city learn to hunt people down through interrogation and questioning, since following tracks is often all but impossible on the busy streets.

**Class**: Ranger.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain Track as a bonus feat.

**Benefit**: He gains Urban Tracking as a bonus feat.

#### Voice of the City

For some, the ability to make oneself understood in the midst of any culture is of far greater value than the ability to influence the beasts of the wild.

**Class**: Druid, ranger, or spirit shaman.

**Level**: 1st.

**Replaces**: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild empathy.

**Benefit**: Through a combination of body language, tone, and expression, the voice of the city can make herself understood by those who do not speak her language, and she can interpret their meaning the same way. Simple concepts that can be conveyed in a few words (such as "Help!" or "Drop your weapon!") can be conveyed automatically. More complex concepts require her to make a roll: d20 + her class level + either her Wisdom modifier (if trying to understand someone else) or Charisma modifier (if trying to make someone else understand her). Roll each only once per conversation. If she fails, she cannot try to communicate with that specific individual via this ability until she has gained a level. (Thus, it is possible, if she succeeds in one roll but fails in the other, to hold a conversation where she can understand the other speaker but he cannot understand you, or vice-versa.)

The DC of the roll depends on creature type and how closely the individual's language is related to any of her own. The ability works most effectively with other humanoids. In this case, if the individual's language uses the same alphabet as any language she knows, the DC is 20. If it does not, the DC is 30. (See Speak Language for this information.)

The above DCs increase by 5 if the speaker is a fey, giant, or monstrous humanoid; they increase by 10 if the speaker is an elemental. If the other individual is of any other creature type, she cannot communicate via this ability.

If the speaker is deliberately trying to make himself understood, the voice of the city gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this roll. If she is attempting to interpret his speech from outside normal conversational distance (such as eavesdropping), she takes a -4 penalty on this roll.

In addition, she gains Speak Language as a class skill.

#### Warrior Ranger

The ranger is a hybrid class, in that he combines martial talents with spellcasting and other abilities. To make this class fit better into a warrior-focused campaign, consider using the following variant that trades the class' spellcasting powers for other extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. In general, this variant class gives up the versatility of daily spell selection in exchange for more powerful or reliable special abilities.

The variant ranger gains all the normal class features of the ranger, with the following changes and additions.

**Spells**: The ranger does not gain the ability to cast divine spells.

**Fast Movement (Ex)**: At 6th level, the ranger's base land speed increases by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.

**Nature's Blessing (Su)**: At 11th level and higher, the ranger can use a standard action to add a +4 bonus to his Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom score. This ability may be used once per day, and its effect lasts for 1 minute per class level.

**Healing Touch (Sp)**: Once per day, a ranger of 13th level or higher can use either [[neutralize poison]] or [[remove disease]], as a caster whose level is equal to one-half the ranger's class level.

**[[Freedom of Movement]] (Sp)**: A ranger of 16th level or higher can use freedom of movement on himself once per day, as a caster whose level is equal to one-half the ranger's class level.



#### Wasteland Ranger

Rangers of the waste are fierce protectors of their homeland. They are masters of desert camouf lage and have adapted weaponry and tactics that mimic those of creatures that share their environment. Desert nomads are most likely to produce rangers, with a wandering lifestyle that prepares them well for the role. This variant ranger gains all the normal class features of the ranger, with the changes below.

**Heat Endurance**: At 3rd level, a wasteland ranger gains Heat Endurance as a bonus feat. If he already has Heat Endurance, the ranger gains Heat Endurance instead and need not meet the prerequisites for that feat. This benefit replaces the standard ranger's Endurance bonus feat.

**Sandskimmer**: At 7th level, a wasteland ranger gains Sandskimmer as a bonus feat. This benefit replaces the standard ranger's woodland stride class feature.

**Waste Hunter (Ex)**: At 10th level, a wasteland ranger chooses a specific kind of favored enemy native to the waste from among the types or subtypes he has already chosen. (For example, he could choose dunewinders if he has magical beasts as a favored enemy.) He gains an additional +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls, and on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks against creatures of this kind. In addition, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on saves against the chosen creature's special abilities and damage reduction 2/- against its physical attacks. This benefit replaces the new favored enemy gained at 10th level by a standard ranger, but the waste ranger's bonuses against previously selected favored enemies increase as if he had gained a new favored enemy.

#### Wild Defender

The wild defender is a holy warrior attuned to the sacred divinity of nature. Druids usually welcome them, but most wild defenders work in solitude. The wild defender guards the land and those who use it respectfully. Those who violate the wilderness consider wild defenders a manifestation of nature's wrath.

The wild defender is a variant ranger. Unless otherwise noted, a wild defender advances in the same manner as a ranger (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of ranger or wild defender, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level ranger twice.

**Alignment**: A wild defender must be neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, or chaotic neutral.

##### Class Features

The wild defender loses the base ranger's favored enemy, bonus feats, combat style, camouflage, and hide in plain sight class features but gains several druid and paladin abilities and acquires some class features at different levels than a ranger.

**Smite Evil (Su)**: Once per day, the wild defender may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per wild defender level. If the wild defender accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, the wild defender may smite enemies one additional time per day, as indicated on the Table: The Wild Defender. A character with levels in both wild defender and paladin adds his levels in both classes to determine how many times per day he may smite evil as well as the amount of extra damage he deals.

**Natural Lore (Ex)**: The wild defender has a +2 bonus on [[Compendium/Basics/Skills/Knowledge]] (nature) and Survival checks.

**Trackless Step (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the wild defender leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

**Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)**: At 4th level, the wild defender gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

**Rebuke Nature (Su)**: When the wild defender reaches 6th level, he gains the ability to rebuke (but not command) creatures of nature, just as an evil cleric can rebuke undead. He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He rebukes nature as a cleric of three levels lower would turn undead. At 6th level, this ability only works on animals, but the wild defender gains control over a wider range of natural creatures as he gains levels.
