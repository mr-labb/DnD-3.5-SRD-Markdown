###### SUBTYPES


**Tanar’ri Traits**: A tanar’ri possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

- Immunity to electricity and poison.
    
- [[Resistance to acid]] 10, cold 10, and fire 10.
    
- _Summon (Sp)_: Tanar’ri share the ability to summon others of their kind (the success chance and type of tanar’ri summoned are noted in each monster description). However, between their arrogance and disdain for owing favors to one another, tanar’ri are often reluctant to use this power until in obvious peril or extreme circumstances.

Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.
