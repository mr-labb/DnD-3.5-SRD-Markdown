###### SUBTYPES

**Augmented Subtype**: A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creatureâ€™s original type. A creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.
