###### SUBTYPES


**Angel Subtype**: Angels are a race of celestials, or good [[outsiders]], native to the good-aligned Outer Planes.

_Traits_: An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

- Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
    
- Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.
    
- Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.
    
- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.
    
- Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a [[magic circle against evil]] effect and a [[lesser globe of invulnerability]], both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics block.)
    
- [[Tongues]] (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a [[tongues]]spell (caster level equal to angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is always active.
