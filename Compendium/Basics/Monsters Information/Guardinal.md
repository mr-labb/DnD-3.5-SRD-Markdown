###### SUBTYPES





**Guardinal Subtype**: Guardinals are a celestial race native to the plane of Elysium. When at home, they are among the most peaceful of creatures, quick to laugh and slow to anger. They show a very different face when away from Elysium, however—they have no tolerance for evil and often rove the cosmos looking for evil to confront.



Guardinals speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature, thanks to their [[tongues]] ability.



A guardinal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).



- Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

- Immunity to electricity and petrification.

- Resistance to cold 10 and sonic 10.

- _Lay on Hands (Su)_: As the paladin class feature, except that each day, a guardinal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.

- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.

- _[[Speak with Animals]] (Su)_: This ability works like [[speak with animals]] (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require sound.
