###### SUBTYPES





**Native Subtype**: A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtypeâ€™s name). Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.
