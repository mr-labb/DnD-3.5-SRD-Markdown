###### SUBTYPES



**Archon Subtype**: Archons are a race of celestials, or good [[outsiders]], native to Celestia.



_Traits_: An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).



- Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

    

- Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.

    

- Immunity to electricity and petrification.

    

- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.

    

- [[Magic Circle against Evil]] (Su): A [[magic circle against evil]] effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon’s statistics block.)

    

- [[Teleport]] (Su): Archons can use [[greater teleport]] at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.

    

- [[Tongues]] (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a [[tongues]] spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
