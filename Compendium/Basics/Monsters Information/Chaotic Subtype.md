###### SUBTYPES



**Chaotic Subtype**: A subtype usually applied only to [[outsiders]] native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes [[damage reduction]] as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned.
