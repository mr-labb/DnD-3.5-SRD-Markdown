### Perform [(Cha)]

Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of
separate skills.

You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each
purchased as a separate skill.

Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of
methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided
for each category below.

-   Act (comedy, drama, mime)
-   Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
-   Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
-   Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
-   Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
-   Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
-   String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
-   Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
-   Sing (ballad, chant, melody)

### Check
You can impress audiences with your talent and skill.

A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on
Perform checks that involve its use.

### Action
Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires
anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's
special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's
description.

### Try Again
Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous
failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is
likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by
2 for each previous failure.)

### Special
A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to
inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his
*fascinate* ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire
competence, 9 ranks to use his *suggestion* ability, 12 ranks to inspire
greatness, 15 ranks to use his *song of freedom* ability, 18 ranks to
inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his *mass suggestion* ability. See
Bardic Music in the bard class description.

In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with
sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially
illusions).
