### Ride [(Dex)]

If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you
take a --5 penalty on your Ride checks.

### Check
Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle,
mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.

The following tasks do require checks.

  1 Armor check penalty applies.                                       
  -------------------------------- --------- ------------------------- ---------

*Guide with Knees:* You can react instantly to guide your mount with
your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride
check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand
this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.

*Stay in Saddle:* You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when
your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This
usage does not take an action.

*Fight with Warhorse:* If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in
battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This
usage is a free action.

*Cover:* You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your
mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using
your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the
cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.

*Soft Fall:* You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you
fall off a mount---when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If
you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This
usage does not take an action.

*Leap:* You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its
movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever
is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride
check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate
falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an
action, but is part of the mount's movement.

*Spur Mount:* You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move
action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet
for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use
this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed
deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points,
4 points, 8 points, and so on).

*Control Mount in Battle:* As a move action, you can attempt to control
a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat
riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing
else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

*Fast Mount or Dismount:* You can attempt to mount or dismount from a
mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action,
provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you
fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't
use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger
than yourself.

### Action
Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action.
Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as
noted above.

### Special
If you are riding bareback, you take a --5 penalty on Ride
checks.

If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on
Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.

The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted
Combat, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge,

Trample.

If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2
bonus on Ride checks.
