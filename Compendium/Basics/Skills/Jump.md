## Jump [(Str; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the
type of jump you are attempting (see below).

Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then
no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less
than 30 feet, you take a --6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less
than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus
for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.

All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which
requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before
attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the
jump is doubled.

Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum
movement in a round.

If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on
your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you
land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.

*Long Jump:* A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a
chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical
height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the
jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).

If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you
fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can
make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your
movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm
or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.

  1 Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.

*High Jump:* A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high
above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the
distance to be cleared.

If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that
you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can
do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump
check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the
same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled
if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.

Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to
the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach
(height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature
of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a
typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)

Quadrupedal creatures don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal
creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.

  --------------- ----------------
  Creature Size   Vertical Reach
  Colossal        128 ft.
  Gargantuan      64 ft.
  Huge            32 ft.
  Large           16 ft.
  Medium          8 ft.
  Small           4 ft.
  Tiny            2 ft.
  Diminutive      1 ft.
  Fine            1/2 ft.

*Hop Up:* You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as
a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10
feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet,
then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to
hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

*Jumping Down:* If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less
damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a
height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so
the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had
dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.

### Action
None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is
part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next
action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be
a move action to complete the jump.

### Special
Effects that increase your movement also increase your
jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed.

If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any
jumps made after a running start.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are
agile and athletic.

If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus
on Jump checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble
checks.
