### Move Silently [(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)]

### Check
Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of
anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed
at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less
than your full speed, you take a --5 penalty. It's practically
impossible (--20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently
across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty
on your Move Silently check as indicated below.

  Noisy (scree, shallow or deep bog, undergrowth, dense rubble)   --2
  Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep snow)                       --5

**Action:**None. A Move Silently check is included in your movement or
other activity, so it is part of another action.
