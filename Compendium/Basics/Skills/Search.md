### Search [(Int)]

### Check
You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface
to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical tasks involving
the Search skill.

|Task|Search DC|
|---|---|
|Ransack a chest full of junk to find a certain item|10|
|Notice a typical secret door or a simple trap|20|
|Find a difficult nonmagical trap (rogue only)1|21 or higher|
|Find a magic trap (rogue only)1|25 + level of spell used to create trap|
|Notice a well-hidden secret door|30|
|Find a footprint|Varies2|
|Sense magic|60|

### Action
It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot
area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.

### Special
An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a
half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who simply
passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a Search
check to find that door.

If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.

The spells *[[explosive runes]], [[fire trap]], [[glyph of warding]], symbol,* and
*[[teleportation circle]]* create magic traps that a rogue can find by
making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using
Disable Device. Identifying the location of a *snare* spell has a DC of
23. *[[Spike growth]]* and *[[spike stones]]* create magic traps that can be
found using Search, but against which Disable Device checks do not
succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or
more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give
you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus
on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering),
you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden
compartments.

### Restriction
While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is
20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps with higher
DCs. (*Exception:* The spell *[[find traps]]* temporarily enables a cleric
to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)

A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a
difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into
or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his
stonecunning ability.
