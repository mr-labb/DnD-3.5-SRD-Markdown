### Craft [(Int)]
You are trained in a craft, trade, or art, such as alchemy, armorsmithing, basketweaving, bookbinding, bowmaking, blacksmithing, calligraphy, carpentry, cobbling, gemcutting, leatherworking, locksmithing, painting, pottery, sculpting, shipmaking, stonemasonry, trapmaking, weaponsmithing, or weaving.

Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.

A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.

### Check : 
You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)

The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.

In some cases, the [[fabricate]] spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the [[ironwood]] spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.

When casting the spell [[minor creation]], you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.

All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.

1. Find the item's price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).
2. Find the DC from the table below.
3. Pay one-third of the item's price for the cost of raw materials.
4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.

If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.

If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

_Progress by the Day_: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.

_Creating Masterwork Items_: You can make a masterwork item - a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.

_Repairing Items_: Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price.

When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.

|Item|Craft Skill|Craft DC|
|---|---|---|
|Acid|Alchemy1|15|
|Alchemist's fire, smokestick, or tindertwig|Alchemy1|20|
|Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone|Alchemy1|25|
|Armor or shield|Armorsmithing|10 + AC bonus|
|Longbow or shortbow|Bowmaking|12|
|Composite longbow or composite shortbow|Bowmaking|15|
|Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high strength rating|Bowmaking|15 + (2 × rating)|
|Crossbow|Weaponsmithing|15|
|Simple melee or thrown weapon|Weaponsmithing|12|
|Martial melee or thrown weapon|Weaponsmithing|15|
|Exotic melee or thrown weapon|Weaponsmithing|18|
|Mechanical trap|Trapmaking|Varies2|
|Very simple item (wooden spoon)|Varies|5|
|Typical item (iron pot)|Varies|10|
|High-quality item (bell)|Varies|15|
|Complex or superior item (lock)|Varies|20|

1 _You must be a spellcaster to craft any of these items._
2 _Traps have their own rules for construction._


_Craft (Poisonmaking)_: The fine art of refining raw materials into effective poisons requires both patience and care (not to mention discretion, in areas where poisons are outlawed). Making poisons with the Craft (poisonmaking) skill follows the rules for all Craft skills, with the following exceptions.

Price: The cost of raw materials varies widely depending on whether the character has access to the active ingredient - that is, the venom or plant that actually provides the toxin. If a supply is readily available, the raw materials cost one-sixth of the market price, not one-third. Otherwise, the raw materials cost at least three-quarters of the market price - assuming the substance in question is for sale at all.

Amount: To figure out how much poison you are able to create in a week, make a Craft (poisonmaking) check at the end of the week. If the check is successful, multiply the check result by the DC for the check. That result is how many gp worth of poison you created that week. When your total gp created equals or exceeds the market price of one dose of the poison, that dose is finished. (You may sometimes be able to create more than one dose in a week, depending on your check result and the market price of the poison.) If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress that week. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to buy them again.

**Table: Craft (Poisonmaking) DCs**

_Creating an Artistic Composition_: In addition to concrete goods, Craft covers artistic endeavors such as writing and musical composition. As with the standard use of the Craft skill, the DC, your check results, and the value of the composition determine how long it takes to compose a musical or written work. The table below summarizes DCs and values for common types of compositions. All the values are expressed as ranges. You can choose your target value for your composition.

The only raw materials required for a written composition are pen, ink, and parchment. In the course of one week's work, you spend about 2 gp on materials. Use this cost rather than the cost of the normal materials (a total of one-third of the item's price). If you are making checks by the day, you spend about 3 sp per day.

|Composition Type|Value|Craft DC|
|---|---|---|
|Poem|5 sp-2 gp|12|
|Novel|5 gp-15 gp|15|
|Reference book|25 gp-100 gp|18|
|Epic|50 gp-500 gp|20|
|Song|5 sp-5 gp|12|
|Quartet or quintet composition|5 gp-15 gp|15|
|Symphony|25 gp-100 gp|20|
|Dramatic monologue|1 gp-5 gp|15|
|Comedic play|10 gp-30 gp|15|
|Dramatic play|15 gp-50 gp|15|

_Craft (boatbuilding)_: Many craft skills are required to fabricate various parts of a ship - carpentry for the hull and masts, blacksmithing for the iron fittings and nails, sailmaking for the sails, even ropemaking for the thousands of feet of hawsers, stays, and line necessary to rig the ship correctly. However, small craft such as canoes, rafts, and skiffs are all covered under Craft (boatbuilding).

A boatbuilder can handle any vessel of Huge size or smaller, although a single boatbuilder working on a ketch or launch of Huge size might take six months or more to finish the work. Building a larger ship requires the skills of a shipwright (see Knowledge). The chief difference between a shipwright and a boatbuilder is that the boatbuilder rarely works off of any sort of plans, instead using various rules-of-thumb and his own skilled eye to build a serviceable vessel.

Some sample Craft DCs for rafts and boats that can be created with the Craft (boatbuilding) skill appear below.

|Type of Boat|Craft DC|
|---|---|
|Crude raft|5|
|Dugout canoe|8|
|Coracle|10|
|Well-made raft|10|
|Skiff|12|
|Launch|15|
|War canoe|18|
|Pinnace|20|

_Repair Warforged_: A character with ranks in certain Craft skills can attempt to repair a warforged character who has taken damage. A check requires 8 hours and restores a number of hit points equal to the Craft check result -15. A character can take 10 on this check but can't take 20. Other constructs can't be repaired in this way (but a character with the Craft Construct feat can repair such a construct). Applicable Craft skills include armorsmithing, blacksmithing, gemcutting, and sculpting. A warforged with an applicable Craft skill can repair itself. Repairing warforged requires some crafting expertise. This particular use of the Craft skill cannot be performed untrained.

_Create Augmented Alchemical Item or Substance:_ This requires the [[Augmented Alchemy]] feat, and allows you to create alchemical items and substances of greater power than normal. To augment an alchemical substance, add +20 to the DC required to create the item and multiply the cost by 5. If the item or substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage, double the duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage and doesn't have a specific listed duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn't fit any of these categories, then it cannot be improved in this manner. You can create an item with multiple degrees of augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or area, add an additional +20 to the DC and add an additional 5 to the cost multiplier.  

|Item|Effect of Augmenting|
|---|---|
|Acid|Direct hit 2d6, splash 2|
|Alchemist's fire|Direct hit 2d6, splash 2|
|Antitoxin|Duration 2 hours|
|Smokestick|Smoke fills a 20-foot cube|
|Sunrod|Glows for 12 hours|
|Tanglefoot bag|Becomes brittle and fragile after 20 minutes|
|Tinderwig|No effect|

### Action : 
Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).

### Try Again : 
Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again. Each time you fail a check by 5 or more when creating an artistic composition, you must start over from the beginning of the creation process.

**Special**: A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.

A gnome has a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because gnomes have sensitive noses.

You can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple of 10. This tactic allows you to create the item more quickly (since you'll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.

To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist's lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.

You can use Craft (blacksmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) instead of Craft (siege engineering) to construct or repair siege weapons by taking a -5 penalty.

### Synergy : 
If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on [[Appraise]] checks related to items made with that Craft skill.
