### Survival [(Wis)]

### Check
You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.
The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival
checks.

Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a
ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section below).

|Survival DC|Task|
|---|---|
|10|Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10.|
|10|Get along in an urban setting without paying for food or services. You can provide relatively clean water and fresh food for one other person for every 2 points by which your check results exceeds 10.|
|15|Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather or underground dangers (such as trapped gases, heat from lava or other volcanic features, and so on) while moving up to one-half your overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15.|
|15|Locate a relatively warm and dry place to stay in for a 24-hour period. You must reroll this check every day.|
|15|Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.|
|15|Keep from getting lost in confusing streets with which you are not familiar.|
|15|Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.|
|20|Get along on the sea without provisions. Provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 20.|
|Varies|Follow tracks (see the Track feat). Most streets in urban settings are a mix of soft (mud) and hard (cobblestones) surfaces.|
|40|Get along in the wild while moving at full speed. You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which the check result exceeds 40.|
|60|Automatically succeed on all Fortitude saves against severe weather. You can extend this benefit to one other person for every 2 points by which the check result exceeds 60.|
|60|Ignore overland movement penalties of terrain. You and your mount can move at full overland speed regardless of terrain. You can extend this benefit to one other person for every 5 points by which the check result exceeds 60.|
|60|Identify race/kind of creature(s) by tracks. Requires the Track feat.|



### Action
Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over
the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks
is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.

### Try Again
Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the
Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check
once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next
check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make
a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid
getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural
hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check
after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.

### Restriction
While anyone can use Survival to find tracks
(regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is
10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat) can use
Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.

### Special
If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you can
automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.

A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find
or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.

If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on Survival
checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.
