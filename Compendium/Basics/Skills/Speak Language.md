### Action
Not applicable.

### Try Again
Not applicable. There are no Speak Language checks to
fail.

The Speak Language skill doesn't work like other skills. Languages work
as follows.

-   You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your
    race), plus an additional number of languages equal to your starting
    Intelligence bonus.
-   You can purchase Speak Language just like any other skill, but
    instead of buying a rank in it, you choose a new language that you
    can speak.
-   You don't make Speak Language checks. You either know a language or
    you don't.
-   A literate character (anyone but a barbarian who has not spent skill
    points to become literate) can read and write any language she
    speaks. Each language has an alphabet, though sometimes several
    spoken languages share a single alphabet.
