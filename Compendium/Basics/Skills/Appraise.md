## Appraise [(Int)]
Use this skill to tell an antique from old junk, a sword that's old and fancy from an elven heirloom, and high-quality jewelry from cheap stuff made to look good.
### Check
You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%) of its actual value.

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value.

A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack.

_Appraise Performance_: In addition to appraising concrete items, any character can appraise the quality of a performance. A successful Appraise check (using the same DCs below) means that you estimate the approximate daily income a performer might be able to expect from a performance of this quality, as shown in the Perform skill description.

A character can also appraise a work being performed to determine its value, just as a physical item can be appraised. See the Craft skill description in this chapter for approximate values for artistic works.

_Fast Appraise_: You can appraise an item quickly, but the DC is higher (see table below). Failing the check means that you cannot estimate the item's value at all, much like Appraise checks made to determine the value of rare or exotic items. Appraising an item quickly takes 1 round.

|Item (Examples)|DC|
|---|---|
|Common (Trade goods, spices, food stuffs, raw materials, mundane items, livestock)|15|
|Rare (Fine clothing, unworked precious metals, gems, artwork)|20|
|Exotic (Unusual gems [strange colorings, unusual to the region, unusually large or pure], spell components, jewelry, obscure religious items)|25|
|Unique (Masterpiece artwork, royal jewels, crowns, or other adornments)|30+|

_Identify Dwarven Craftwork_: You can tell whether an item is dwarvencraft or of dwarven manufacture or by making a successful DC 10 Appraise check.

_[[Detect Magic]]_: With a DC 50 Appraise check, you can sense if an item has a magical aura. You can then use Spellcraft to learn more about the item as if you have already cast [[detect magic]] on the item. This requires a full-round action.

### Action
Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive
full-round actions).

### Try Again
No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless
of success.

### Special
A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are
related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with
valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).

The master of a [[raven]] familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus
on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.

### Untrained
For common items, failure on an untrained check means no
estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150%
(2d6+3 times 10%).
