### Tumble [(Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)]

You can't use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess
equipment, or loot.

### Check
You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents.
You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the
Perform skill). The DCs for various tasks involving the Tumble skill are
given on the table below.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Tumble DC                         | Task                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 15                                | Treat a fall as if it were 10     |
|                                   | feet shorter than it really is    |
|                                   | when determining damage.          |

|                                   | doing so. Failure means you       |
|                                   | provoke attacks of opportunity    |
|                                   | normally. Check separately for    |

|                                   | Failure means you stop before     |
|                                   | entering the enemy-occupied area  |
|                                   | and provoke an attack of          |

Obstructed or otherwise treacherous surfaces, such as natural cavern
floors or undergrowth, are tough to tumble through. The DC for any
Tumble check made to tumble into such a square is modified as indicated
below.

*Accelerated Tumbling:* You try to tumble past or through enemies more
quickly than normal. By accepting a --10 penalty on your Tumble checks,
you can move at your full speed instead of one-half your speed.

### Action
Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement, so a Tumble
check is part of a move action.

### Try Again
Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as
an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.

You can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only
once per fall.

### Special
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 dodge
bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 dodge
bonus to AC.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC
when executing the total defense standard action instead of the usual +4
dodge bonus to AC.

If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.

### Synergy
If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus
on Balance and Jump checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble
checks.
