### MARTIAL LORE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)

You can use this skill to identify martial maneuvers as soon as they are initiated.

### Check
You can identify maneuvers and disciplines used by a combatant. The DCs for Martial Lore checks relating to various tasks are summarized below.
Martial Lore DC 	Task
10 + maneuver level 	Identify a maneuver being initiated by someone you can see. No action required. No retry.
10 + maneuver level 	Identify a maneuver recorded on a martial script. One try per day. Requires a full-round action.
20 + target's initiator level 	Determine all disciplines known by a particular creature by watching it initiate at least one maneuver. No action required. Retry only if the subject initiates another maneuver.

### Action
Varies, as noted above.

### Try Again
See above.

### Special
A swordsage gains a +2 bonus on a Martial Lore check involving a maneuver in a discipline in which he has discipline focus.
MOVE SILENTLY (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)

You can use this skill to sneak up behind an enemy or to slink away without being noticed.

Check: Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.

Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.
Surface 	Check Modifier
Noisy (scree, shallow or deep bog, undergrowth, dense rubble) 	-2
Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep snow) 	-5

Action: None. A Move Silently check is included in your movement or other activity, so it is part of another action.

Special: The master of a cat familiar gains a +3 bonus on Move Silently checks.

A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks.
