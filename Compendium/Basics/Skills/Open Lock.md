### Open Lock [(Dex; Trained Only)]

Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a
--2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is
employed. If you use masterwork thieves' tools, you gain a +2
circumstance bonus on the check.

### Check
The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on
the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.


|Lock|DC|Lock|DC|
|---|---|---|---|
|Very simple lock|20|Good lock|30|
|Average lock|25|Amazing lock|40|

_Quick Lockpick_: You can try to open a lock more quickly than normal. To reduce the time required to open any lock, add the DC modifiers below. For example, opening an average lock normally requires a DC 25 check and requires a full-round action. To open the lock as a move action requires a DC 45 check.

|Open lock as...|DC Modifier|
|---|---|
|Move-equivalent action|+20|
|Free action|+50|

### Action
Opening a lock is a full-round action.

### Special
If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on
Open Lock checks.

### Untrained
You cannot pick locks untrained, but you might
successfully force them open.
