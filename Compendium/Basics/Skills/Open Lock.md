### Open Lock [(Dex; Trained Only)]

Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a
--2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is
employed. If you use masterwork thieves' tools, you gain a +2
circumstance bonus on the check.

### Check
The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on
the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.

  ------------------ ---- -------------- ----
  Lock               DC   Lock           DC

  Average lock       25   Amazing lock   40
  ------------------ ---- -------------- ----

### Action
Opening a lock is a full-round action.

### Special
If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on
Open Lock checks.

### Untrained
You cannot pick locks untrained, but you might
successfully force them open.
