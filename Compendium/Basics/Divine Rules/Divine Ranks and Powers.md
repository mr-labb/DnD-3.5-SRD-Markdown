# Divine Ranks and Powers

## Divine Ranks

Each deity possesses a divine rank, which determines its level of power and influence.

### Rank 0
Also called quasi-deities or hero deities, creatures of this rank are often born of a mortal and a deity. Although they cannot grant spells, they are immortal and usually exhibit ability scores well beyond the norm for their species. They may have some worshipers. Ordinary mortals do not possess a divine rank.

### Rank 1–5
Known as demigods, these are the least powerful true deities. They can grant spells and perform supernatural feats beyond mortal limits. A demigod might have from a few hundred to several thousand mortal worshipers and command respect from more. They control a small divine realm (usually on an Outer Plane) and have minor control over a portfolio related to mortal existence. Their talents often include mastery of a skill or group of skills, combat prowess in specific circumstances, or the ability to induce slight reality shifts.

### Rank 6–10
Lesser deities can grant spells and perform greater feats than demigods. They have several thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers and govern larger realms. Their perception is sharper within their domains.

### Rank 11–15
Intermediate deities command hundreds of thousands of mortal worshipers and maintain vast godly realms. Their authority and awareness exceed those of lesser deities.

### Rank 16–20
Greater deities may be worshiped by millions and are revered even by other gods. They often rule pantheons and command divine hierarchies, much like mortal rulers govern citizens.

### Rank 21+
Overdeities are far beyond mortal comprehension and generally uninterested in worship. They do not grant spells, answer prayers, or respond to inquiries. Their existence is known only to a handful of scholars on the Material Plane. In some cosmologies, the ascent to godhood requires the approval of an overdeity.

### Speed

Deities move significantly faster than mortals. Their base land speed depends on their form (biped or quadruped) and size. Use the following table to determine base speed:

| Size        | Biped Form\* | Quadruped Form\*\* |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Fine        | 20 ft.       | 60 ft.             |
| Diminutive  | 30 ft.       | 70 ft.             |
| Tiny        | 40 ft.       | 80 ft.             |
| Small       | 50 ft.       | 90 ft.             |
| Medium      | 60 ft.       | 100 ft.            |
| Large       | 80 ft.       | 120 ft.            |
| Huge        | 100 ft.      | 140 ft.            |
| Gargantuan  | 120 ft.      | 160 ft.            |
| Colossal    | 140 ft.      | 180 ft.            |

\* Applies to any form with two or fewer legs  
\*\* Applies to any form with three or more legs

**Special Notes:**
- Use the **Biped** column for **burrow** and **swim** speeds, regardless of form.
- Use **half** the **Biped** value for **climb** speed.
- Use **twice** the **Quadruped** value for **fly** speed for flying deities.

### Armor Class

A divine field surrounds a deity, granting it a bonus to Armor Class (AC) equal to its divine rank. This bonus stacks with all other AC bonuses and applies against touch and incorporeal touch attacks.

- Most outsider deities (those with 20 HD) gain natural armor equal to their divine rank +13.
- All deities gain a deflection bonus equal to their Charisma modifier (if any).
- Non-outsider deities use their normal natural armor bonus plus their divine rank.
- Individual deity entries may include additional AC modifiers.

### Attacks

A deity’s base attack bonus is determined by its type, Hit Dice, and character levels. Additionally:
- Melee and ranged touch attack bonuses (used for spells or spell-like abilities) are listed alongside weapon attacks.
- Deities gain a **divine bonus equal to their rank** on all attack rolls.
- Deities of rank 1+ do **not automatically fail** on a natural roll of 1.

**Bypassing Damage Reduction:**
As outsiders with alignment subtypes, a deity’s natural attacks and wielded weapons count as aligned to their own alignment.

### Always Maximize Roll

Greater deities (rank 16–20) always achieve the maximum result possible on:
- Ability checks
- Saving throws
- Attack rolls
- Damage rolls

They are treated as if rolling a natural 20 for success calculations. A d20 is still rolled to determine threats for critical hits. This inherent trait removes the need for the Maximize Spell feat.

### Saving Throws

Base saving throws are determined by outsider Hit Dice and character level. Deities add their divine rank as a **divine bonus**. Deities of rank 1+ do **not automatically fail** on a natural roll of 1.

### Checks

Deities add their divine rank as a **divine bonus** on:
- Skill checks
- Ability checks
- Caster level checks
- Turning checks

**Automatic Success:**
- **Lesser deities (rank 6–10):** may take 10 on any check.
- **Intermediate and greater deities (rank 11–20):** always succeed as if rolling a 20.

**Synergy Bonus Extension:**
For every **20 extra skill ranks**, synergy bonuses (if applicable) increase by +2.

### Armor Class
A field of divine energy encompasses a deity's body,
granting it a divine Armor Class bonus equal to its divine rank. This
bonus stacks with all other Armor Class bonuses and is effective against
touch attacks and incorporeal touch attacks.

Most deities (all those with 20 outsider Hit Dice) have a natural armor
bonus of their divine rank +13. All deities also have a deflection bonus
to their AC equal to their Charisma bonus (if any).

Deities who aren't outsiders have their normal natural armor bonus +
their divine rank.

Many deities have other Armor Class bonuses as noted in their individual
descriptions.

### Attacks
A deity's Hit Dice and type and character level determine
its base attack bonus. In addition to the figures for weapon attacks,
this section of the statistics block also includes melee touch attack
and ranged touch attack bonuses, to be used when the deity casts a spell
or uses a spell-like ability that requires a touch attack to affect its
target. A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all attack
rolls. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not automatically fail on a
natural attack roll of 1.

*Bypassing Damage Reduction:* As outsiders with alignment subtypes, the
natural attacks of deities, as well as any weapons they wield, are
considered aligned the same as the deity for the purposes of bypassing
damage reduction.

### Always Maximize Roll
Greater deities (rank 16--20) automatically
get the best result possible on any check, saving throw, attack roll, or
damage roll. Calculate success, failure, or other effects accordingly.
When a greater deity makes a check, attack, or save assume a 20 was
rolled and calculate success or failure from there. A d20 should still
be rolled and used to check for a threat of a critical hit. This quality
means that greater deities never need the Maximize Spell feat, because
their spells have maximum effect already.

### Saving Throws
A deity's outsider Hit Dice and character level
determine its base saving throw bonuses. A deity gets its divine rank as
a divine bonus on all saving throws. Deities of rank 1 or higher do not
automatically fail on a natural saving throw roll of 1.

### Checks
A deity gets its divine rank as a divine bonus on all skill
checks, ability checks, caster level checks, and turning checks. Lesser
deities (rank 6--10) may take 10 on any check, provided they need to
make a check at all. Intermediate and greater deities (rank 11--20)
always get a result of 20 on any check, provided they need to make a
check at all.

*Deities and Synergy Bonuses*: For every 20 extra ranks a deity has in a
skill, the deity's synergy bonus from the skill (if any) increases by
+2.

### Immunities

Deities possess the following immunities, with stronger deities gaining additional protections. These do not apply against deities of equal or higher rank unless specified.

- **Transmutation:** Immune to polymorph, petrification, or other form-altering effects. They can still shape-change themselves normally.
- **Energy Drain / Ability Drain / Ability Damage:** Fully immune.
- **Mind-Affecting Effects:** Immune to charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects.
- **Energy Immunity:** Deities of rank 1+ are immune to electricity, cold, and acid. Some may be immune to more energy types.
- **Disease, Poison, Stunning, Sleep, Paralysis, Death Effects, Disintegration:** Immunity begins at rank 1.
- **Imprisonment and Banishment (rank 6+):** Immune to effects such as *banishment, binding, dimensional anchor, dismissal, imprisonment, repulsion, soul bind, temporal stasis, trap the soul*, and turning/rebuking.

### Damage Reduction

A deity gains damage reduction based on its rank:

| Divine Rank            | Damage Reduction |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Quasi-deity (0)        | 10/epic          |
| Demigod (1–5)          | 15/epic          |
| Lesser deity (6–10)    | 20/epic          |
| Intermediate deity (11–15) | 25/epic      |
| Greater deity (16–20)  | 30/epic          |

If a deity has multiple types of damage reduction, only the strongest applies.

### Resistances

Deities possess baseline resistances:

- **Energy Resistance:** Fire resistance = 5 + divine rank.
- **Spell Resistance:** Spell resistance = 32 + divine rank.

### Salient Divine Abilities

Each deity of rank 1+ gains one **salient divine ability** per divine rank. These are unique powers further detailed in the *Salient Divine Abilities* section.

### Domain Powers

Deities of rank 1+ may use any domain power they grant, up to a number of times per day equal to their divine rank. If the power scales with cleric level and the deity has no cleric levels, use an effective level = divine rank (or half rank if specified).

### Spell-Like Abilities

Deities may use any domain spell they grant as a spell-like ability **at will**. 

- Effective caster level = 10 + divine rank  
- Save DC = 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier + divine rank

### Immortality

All deities are naturally immortal:
- Cannot die from aging or natural causes
- Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe
- Rank 1+ deities cannot die from massive damage

### Senses

Deities have heightened senses that scale with divine rank:
- Sensory radius = 1 mile per divine rank  
- Applies to normal senses, including darkvision or low-light vision if applicable

**Remote Sensing:**  
Deities of rank 1+ may perceive events from afar, centered on:
- Worshipers
- Sacred sites
- Locations where their name/title was spoken within 1 hour
- Events involving their domain

| Divine Rank | Remote Locations Perceivable |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1–5         | 2                            |
| 6–10        | 5                            |
| 11–15       | 10                           |
| 16–20       | 20                           |

**Block Sensing:**  
As a standard action, deities of rank 1+ may block the sensing ability of lower-ranked deities in:
- A 1-mile-per-rank radius around themselves
- Sacred locations or domain-related events
Can block 2 remote locations + area around themselves for 1 hour per rank.


### Portfolio

Every deity of rank 1 or higher holds knowledge and control over a specific aspect of mortal existence, referred to as its portfolio.

**Portfolio Sense:**
Deities gain awareness of events tied to their portfolio, based on rank:

- **Demigods:** Sense events involving 1,000+ people; applies only to the present.
- **Lesser deities:** Sense portfolio events affecting 500+ people.
- **Intermediate deities:** Sense all events tied to their portfolio, regardless of scale. Can sense back in time—1 week per divine rank.
- **Greater deities:** Sense all events related to their domain, with retroactive and predictive awareness—1 week into the past and future per rank.

Portfolio sense gives knowledge of event occurrence and location but does not grant detailed sensory information. Deities can use remote sensing to observe further.

### Automatic Actions

When acting within their domain, deities may perform tasks as free actions if the check’s DC is within threshold. The number of free actions per round is also determined by rank.

| Divine Rank | Max DC for Free Action | Free Actions / Round |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 1–5         | 15                      | 2                      |
| 6–10        | 20                      | 5                      |
| 11–15       | 25                      | 10                     |
| 16–20       | 30                      | 20                     |

### Create Magic Items

Deities of rank 1+ can craft magic items related to their domain without possessing the specific item creation feat. They must still meet all other prerequisites.

| Divine Rank | Max Item Market Value      |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 1–5         | 4,500 gp                    |
| 6–10        | 30,000 gp                   |
| 11–15       | 200,000 gp (non-artifact)  |
| 16–20       | No maximum (includes artifacts) |

If the deity possesses the appropriate item creation feat, crafting time and resource costs (XP and gp) are halved.

### Divine Aura

The presence of a deity of rank 1+ exerts a powerful aura that affects mortals and lower-ranked deities. All divine aura effects are mind-affecting extraordinary abilities.

- **Save DC:** 10 + divine rank + Charisma modifier
- Those who succeed on a Will save are immune to that deity’s aura for 24 hours
- Deities are immune to auras from deities of equal or lower rank
- A deity can suppress or customize the radius and choose to exempt its worshipers and those who share its alignment

| Divine Rank | Aura Radius                |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1–5         | 10 ft. / rank              |
| 6–15        | 100 ft. / rank             |
| 16–20       | 1 mile / rank              |

**Aura Effects (choose one per round):**
- **Daze:** Creatures stare in awe; they can defend but not act.
- **Fright:** Creatures become shaken (–2 penalty on attacks, saves, checks) and flee.
- **Resolve:** Allies gain +4 morale bonus on attacks, saves, checks; foes take –4 penalty.

### Grant Spells

Deities automatically grant spells and domain powers to divine spellcasters who worship them. Depending on their class levels, they may grant spells from:

- **Cleric, Ranger:** Most deities
- **Druid:** If deity has druid levels
- **Paladin:** If deity has paladin levels

A deity can revoke spell access from individual mortals as a free action. Granted spells remain in the caster’s memory until used.

### Spontaneous Casting

Deities of rank 1+ with levels in divine casting classes may spontaneously cast any spell they can grant.

### Communication

Deities of rank 1+ can:
- Understand, speak, and read any language (including nonverbal)
- Speak directly to any beings within 1 mile per divine rank

**Remote Communication:**
As a standard action, a deity can communicate telepathically or vocally with:
- Its worshipers
- Anyone within 1 mile/rank of a dedicated site, statue, or likeness

Communication can manifest as:
- A voice from the air, ground, or a chosen object
- An omen or phenomenon related to the deity’s nature
Messages may cross planes and bypass all barriers except those placed by equal/higher-ranked deities.

### Godly Realm

Deities of rank 1+ possess a personal domain that serves as residence, sanctuary, and seat of power. They exert environmental control based on rank and plane location.

| Divine Rank | Control Radius (Outer Plane) | Control Radius (Material Plane) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1–5         | 100 ft. / rank                | 100 ft. / rank                   |
| 6–10        | 1 mile                        | 100 ft. / rank                   |
| 11–15       | 10 miles                      | 100 ft. / rank                   |
| 16–20       | 100 miles                     | 100 ft. / rank                   |

**Environmental Control:**
- Adjust temperature, scents, ambient sounds
- Sounds limited to 100 human voices (no intelligible speech unless rank 6+)
- Rank 11+ may apply **enhanced/impeded magic traits** to spell groups
- Rank 11+ can freely build structures and reshape terrain within 10 miles

**Rank 16+ Powers:**
- Control gravity, energy, or time traits
- Apply **limited magic trait** to suppress specific spell types (does not restrict the deity’s own spells)

**Changes to realm conditions:**
- Environmental adjustments: take effect within 10 minutes
- Altering astral links or terrain: requires 1 year + 1 day of labor (8 hours/day)

### Travel

Deities of rank 1+ can use:
- *Teleport without error* at will (self + 100 lb. of objects per rank)
- Rank 6+: *Plane shift* at will (same weight limit)
- Companions (familiar, mount, intelligent weapon) may travel with the deity if touched

### Familiar

Deities of rank 1+ with sorcerer or wizard levels can treat any one creature within 1 mile per rank as a familiar. This special familiar may be switched at will if another eligible creature is within range. This ability is separate from and does not replace the deity’s standard familiar.
