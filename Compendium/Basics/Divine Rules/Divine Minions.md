# Divine Minions

Any kind of creature may serve deities, but typically only those who have accomplished a great deed in their patron’s name are accepted as divine minions. These minions usually share the same alignment as the deity — no minion’s alignment may oppose their patron’s alignment on either the **law–chaos** or **good–evil** axis.

## Proxies

Divine proxies act on behalf of their deity when the demand for divine attention exceeds capacity. A proxy is a servant invested with **1 divine rank**, temporarily transferred from the patron deity. This reduces the deity’s rank by 1 while the proxy holds it.

- The proxy must be **physically present** for investiture.
- While invested, they gain any **salient divine abilities** of the deity and powers of a **rank 1 demigod**.
- Some powers may be inaccessible if the proxy lacks appropriate ability scores or prerequisites.
- A deity may reclaim the invested rank **as a standard action** — no physical contact required.
- Multiple proxies are allowed, each costing the deity one rank.

## Petitioners

Some spirits show their devotion by making the dangerous journey to their deity’s home plane. Survivors of this pilgrimage may become **petitioners**, or divine servants, transformed by their patron’s will.

Petitioners typically retain the **form they had at death**, though deities may reshape them to match their realm. Petitioners must have had at least **1 Intelligence and 1 Wisdom** in life.

Eligible creature types include:

- Aberrations  
- Animals  
- Dragons  
- Fey  
- Giants  
- Humanoids  
- Magical beasts  
- Monstrous humanoids  
- Plants, oozes, vermin (if sufficiently intelligent)

**Excluded types:**

- Constructs and undead (though their original spirits may qualify)
- Elementals and outsiders typically merge with their native plane and do not become petitioners, though they may be recalled.

> Note: This template applies to NPCs only. Player characters restored from petitioner status **lose all memories** of that time.

## Creating a Petitioner

The **Petitioner** template may be applied to any creature at the DM’s discretion. The creature becomes an **Outsider** and retains its original statistics except as modified below.

### Hit Dice
Set to **2d8**, retaining bonus hit points.

### Armor Class (AC)
Applies bonuses/penalties from **Dexterity, size, and natural armor**. **Armor bonuses** do not apply.

### Attacks
Base Attack Bonus (BAB) set to **+2**, adjusted for size and Strength.

### Special Attacks
Loser of all **supernatural and spell-like attacks**. Retains **normal and exceptional attacks**.

### Special Qualities
- Loses all **supernatural and spell-like abilities**
- Retains **exceptional abilities**
- Gains the following traits:

**Mental Immunity:** Immune to all mind-affecting effects  
**Other Immunities:** Immune to **two** of the following (chosen by plane or deity):  
`acid`, `cold`, `electricity`, `fire`, `poison`, `petrifaction`, `polymorphing`  
**Energy Resistance:** Resistance 20 to **two** of the following, as determined by plane:  
`acid`, `cold`, `electricity`, `fire`  
**Planar Commitment:** Petitioners **cannot leave their native plane**. If forced to exit, they are teleported **100 miles in a random direction**.  
**Additional Traits (plane-dependent):** May include any one of the following:

- Damage reduction 5/silver and spell resistance 5  
- Continuous *magic circle against evil*  
- Fast healing 1  
- Damage reduction 10/magic  
- Spell resistance 10  
- Additional 2d8 HD  
- Complete removal of immunities and resistances except mind-affecting immunity, plus resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison

These modifications depend on **cosmic traits** or the plane's dominant powers.

### Saving Throws
Base bonuses set to **+3** across all save types.

### Abilities
Same as base creature. Some cosmologies cap ability scores at **18** — excess scores are reduced.

### Skills & Feats
Petitioners **lose all skills and feats** from life.

### Climate/Terrain
Any land or underground area on their native plane.

### Organization
As per the base creature.

### Challenge Rating
Set to **1**.

### Treasure
None.

### Alignment
Matches the native plane.

### Advancement
None.

## Exceptional Petitioners

Some deities choose unique servants for special tasks — **exceptional petitioners**. These retain feats and skills from life but otherwise conform to the petitioner template.
