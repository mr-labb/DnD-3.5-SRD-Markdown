### Craft Wondrous Item 
***Feat Type: Item Creation***

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 3rd.

**Benefit:** You can create any wondrous item whose prerequisites you
meet. Enchanting a wondrous item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its
price. To enchant a wondrous item, you must spend 1/25 of the item's
price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price.

You can also mend a broken wondrous item if it is one that you could
make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the
time it would take to craft that item in the first place.

Some wondrous items incur extra costs in material components or XP, as
noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those
derived from the item's base price. You must pay such a cost to create
an item or to mend a broken one.
