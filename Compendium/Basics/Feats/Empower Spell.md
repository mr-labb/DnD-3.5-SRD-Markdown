### Empower Spell 
***Feat Type: Metamagic***

**Benefit:** All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are
increased by one-half.

Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without
random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels
higher than the spell's actual level.
