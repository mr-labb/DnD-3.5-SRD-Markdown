### Craft Staff 
***Feat Type: Item Creation***

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 12th.

**Benefit:** You can create any staff whose prerequisites you meet.

Crafting a staff takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To
craft a staff, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up
raw materials costing one-half of its base price. A newly created staff
has 50 charges.

Some staffs incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in
their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from
the staff 's base price.
