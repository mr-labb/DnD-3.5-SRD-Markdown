### Martial Weapon Proficiency 
***Feat Type: General***

Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of
martial weapon in combat.

**Benefit:** You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally.

**Normal:** When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you
take a --4 penalty on attack rolls.

**Special:** Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient
with all martial weapons. They need not select this feat.

You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you
take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.

A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial
Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity's favored weapon as a bonus
feat, if the weapon is a martial one. He need not select it.
