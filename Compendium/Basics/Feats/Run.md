### Run 
***Feat Type: General***

**Benefit:** When running, you move five times your normal speed (if
wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium
load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a
heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump
skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While
running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.

**Normal:** You move four times your speed while running (if wearing
medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or
three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy
load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.
