### Brew Potion 
***Feat Type: Item Creation***

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 3rd.

**Benefit:** You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell
that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion
takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which
must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your
own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level x its caster
level x 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price
in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.

When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally
make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of
the spell.

Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP
cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived
from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the
XP when creating the potion.
