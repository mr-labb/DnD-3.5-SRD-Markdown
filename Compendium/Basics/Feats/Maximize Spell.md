### Maximize Spell 
***Feat Type: Metamagic***

**Benefit:** All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this
feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected,
nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a
spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat:
the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.
