### Extra Turning 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Ability to turn or rebuke creatures.

**Benefit:** Each time you take this feat, you can use your ability to
turn or rebuke creatures four more times per day than normal.

If you have the ability to turn or rebuke more than one kind of creature
each of your turning or rebuking abilities gains four additional uses
per day.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a character can typically turn or rebuke
undead (or other creatures) a number of times per day equal to 3 + his
or her Charisma modifier.

**Special:** You can gain Extra Turning multiple times. Its effects
stack. Each time you take the feat, you can use each of your turning or
rebuking abilities four additional times per day.
