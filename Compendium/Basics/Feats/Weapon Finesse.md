### Weapon Finesse 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for
a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier
instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a
shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

**Special:** A fighter may select Weapon Finesse as one of his fighter
bonus feats.

Natural weapons are always considered light weapons.
