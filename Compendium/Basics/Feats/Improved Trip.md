### Improved Trip 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, Combat Expertise.

**Benefit:** You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you
attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed. You also gain a +4
bonus on your Strength check to trip your opponent.

If you trip an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a melee
attack against that opponent as if you hadn't used your attack for the
trip attempt.

**Normal:** Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when
you attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed.

**Special:** At 6th level, a monk may select Improved Trip as a bonus
feat, even if she does not have the prerequisites.

A fighter may select Improved Trip as one of his fighter bonus feats.
