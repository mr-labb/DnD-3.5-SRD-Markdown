### Improved Two-Weapon Fighting 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** In addition to the standard single extra attack you get
with an off-hand weapon, you get a second attack with it, albeit at a
--5 penalty.

**Normal:** Without this feat, you can only get a single extra attack
with an off-hand weapon.

**Special:** A fighter may select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting as one of
his fighter bonus feats.

A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated
as having Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, even if he does not have the
prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
