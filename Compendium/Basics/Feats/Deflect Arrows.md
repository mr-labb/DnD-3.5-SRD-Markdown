### Deflect Arrows 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.

**Benefit:** You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to
use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a
ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it.
You must be aware of the attack and not flatfooted.

Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action.
Unusually massive ranged weapons and ranged attacks generated by spell
effects can't be deflected.

**Special:** A monk may select Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat at 2nd
level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

A fighter may select Deflect Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.
