### Eschew Materials 
***Feat Type: General***

**Benefit:** You can cast any spell that has a material component
costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. (The casting of the
spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.) If the spell
requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have
the material component at hand to cast the spell, just as normal.
