### Craft Magic Arms and Armor 
***Feat Type: Item Creation***

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can create any magic weapon, armor, or shield whose
prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield
takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To
enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must spend 1/25 of its
features' total price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of
this total price.

The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item
that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.

You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it
is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw
materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the
first place.
