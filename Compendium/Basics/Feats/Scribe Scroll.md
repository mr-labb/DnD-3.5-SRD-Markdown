### Scribe Scroll 
***Feat Type: Item Creation***

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 1st.

**Benefit:** You can create a scroll of any spell that you know.
Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The
base price of a scroll is its spell level x its caster level x 25 gp. To
scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up
raw materials costing one-half of this base price.

Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP
cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived
from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the
XP when scribing the scroll.
