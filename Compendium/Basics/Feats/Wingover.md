### Wingover 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Fly speed.

**Benefits:** A flying creature with this feat can change direction
quickly once each round as a free action. This feat allows it to turn up
to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuverability, in addition to any
other turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot gain altitude
during a round when it executes a wingover, but it can dive.

The change of direction consumes 10 feet of flying movement.
