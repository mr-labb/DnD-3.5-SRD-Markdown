### Rapid Reload 
***Feat Type: General***

Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).

**Prerequisite:** Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).

**Benefit:** The time required for you to reload your chosen type of
crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a
move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes
an attack of opportunity.

If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you
may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could
attack if you were using a bow.

**Normal:** A character without this feat needs a move action to reload
a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy
crossbow.

**Special:** You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you
take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.

A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.
