### Quicken Spell-Like Ability 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite**: Spell-like ability at caster level 10th or higher.

**Benefit**: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described below. The creature can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action—including the use of another spell-like ability—in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) –4. For a summary, see the table below.

In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.

**Normal**: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise.

**Special**: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
