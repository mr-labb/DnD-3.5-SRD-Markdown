### Empower Spell-Like Ability 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject
to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an
empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the
ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable,
numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by one half.
Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities
without random variables are not affected.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell
with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down)
--2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken
Spell-Like Ability feat.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is
taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like
abilities.
