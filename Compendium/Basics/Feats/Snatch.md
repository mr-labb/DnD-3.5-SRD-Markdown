### Snatch 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Size Huge or larger.

**Benefits:** The creature can choose to start a grapple when it hits
with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the improved grab special
attack. If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or more sizes
smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage. A
snatched opponent held in the creature's mouth is not allowed a Reflex
save against the creature's breath weapon, if it has one.

The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action or use
a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6 x 10
feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the
creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes
this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.
