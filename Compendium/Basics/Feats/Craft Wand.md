### Craft Wand 
***Feat Type: Item Creation***

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that
you know. Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base
price. The base price of a wand is its caster level x the spell level x
750 gp. To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP
and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price. A newly
created wand has 50 charges.

Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP
cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived
from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material
component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
