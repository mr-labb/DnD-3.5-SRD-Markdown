### Mounted Combat 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Ride 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may
attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is
negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack
roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount's Armor
Class if it's higher than the mount's regular AC.)

**Special:** A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter
bonus feats.
