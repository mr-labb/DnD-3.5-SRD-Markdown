### Combat Expertise 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Int 13.

**Benefit:** When you use the attack action or the full attack action in
melee, you can take a penalty of as much as --5 on your attack roll and
add the same number (+5 or less) as a dodge bonus to your Armor Class.
This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The changes to attack
rolls and Armor Class last until your next action.

**Normal:** A character without the Combat Expertise feat can fight
defensively while using the attack or full attack action to take a --4
penalty on attack rolls and gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

**Special:** A fighter may select Combat Expertise as one of his fighter
bonus feats.
