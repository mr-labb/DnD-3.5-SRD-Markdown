### Diehard 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Endurance.

**Benefit:** When reduced to between --1 and --9 hit points, you
automatically become stable. You don't have to roll d% to see if you
lose 1 hit point each round.

When reduced to negative hit points, you may choose to act as if you
were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as
you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If
you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall
unconscious.

When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard
action each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full round action.
You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you
perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous,
including some free actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take
1 point of damage after completing the act. If you reach --10 hit
points, you immediately die.

**Normal:** A character without this feat who is reduced to between --1
and --9 hit points is unconscious and dying.
