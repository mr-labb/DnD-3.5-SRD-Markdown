### Blind-Fight 
***Feat Type: General***

**Benefit:** In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you
can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you
actually hit.

An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in
melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and
the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The
invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.

You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see.
Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to
three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.

**Normal:** Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying
to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed
reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.

**Special:** The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who
is the subject of a *[[blink]]* spell.

A fighter may select Blind-Fight as one of his fighter bonus feats.
