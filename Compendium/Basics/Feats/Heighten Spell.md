### Heighten Spell 
***Feat Type: Metamagic***

**Benefit:** A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up
to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell
actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies.
All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and
ability to penetrate a *[[Globe of Invulnerability Lesser|lesser globe of invulnerability]]*) are calculated
according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult
to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.
