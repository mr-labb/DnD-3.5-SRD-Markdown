### Widen Spell 
***Feat Type: Metamagic***

**Benefit:** You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped
spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area
increase by 100%.A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels
higher than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not
affected by this feat.
