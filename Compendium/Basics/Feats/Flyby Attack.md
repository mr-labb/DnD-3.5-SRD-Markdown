### Flyby Attack 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Fly speed.

**Benefit:** When flying, the creature can take a move action (including
a dive) and another standard action at any point during the move. The
creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a
flyby attack.

**Normal:** Without this feat, the creature takes a standard action
either before or after its move.
