### Awesome Blow 
***Feat Type: General, Fighter***

**Prerequisites:** Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush, size Large
or larger.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, the creature may choose to subtract 4
from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome blow. If the creature
hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its
opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked
flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking creature's choice and
fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a
straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the attacking
creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the
completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each
take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent
to the obstacle.
