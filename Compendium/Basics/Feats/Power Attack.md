### Power Attack 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisite:** Str 13.

**Benefit:** On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you
may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the
same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your
base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply
until your next turn.

**Special:** If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a
one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number
subtracted from your attack rolls. You can't add the bonus from Power
Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed
strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack
rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a
one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double
weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a
round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)

A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.
