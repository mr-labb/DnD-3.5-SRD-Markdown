### Quicken Spell 
***Feat Type: Metamagic***

**Benefit:** Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform
another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you
cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round.
A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round action cannot be
quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher
than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke
an attack of opportunity.

**Special:** This feat can't be applied to any spell cast spontaneously
(including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells cast
spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast
spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.
