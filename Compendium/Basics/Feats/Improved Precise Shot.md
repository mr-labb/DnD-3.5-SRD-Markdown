### Improved Precise Shot 
***Feat Type: General***

**Prerequisites:** Dex 19, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack
bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets
by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to
targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total
concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.

In addition, when you shoot or throw ranged weapons at a grappling
opponent, you automatically strike at the opponent you have chosen.

**Normal:** See the normal rules on the effects of cover and
concealment. Without this feat, a character who shoots or throws a
ranged weapon at a target involved in a grapple must roll randomly to
see which grappling combatant the attack strikes.

**Special:** A fighter may select Improved Precise Shot as one of his
fighter bonus feats.

An 11th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated
as having Improved Precise Shot, even if he does not have the
prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
