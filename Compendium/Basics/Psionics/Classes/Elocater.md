: Table: The Elocater

#### Class Features

All the following are class features of the elocater prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Elocaters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor.

### Powers Known
At every level indicated on the table, the character gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of elocater to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.

If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became an elocater, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of elocater for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

### Scorn Earth (Su)
At 1st level, an elocater's feet lift from the ground. From now on, she can float a foot above the ground. Instead of walking she glides along, unconcerned with the hard earth or difficult terrain. While she remains within 1 foot of a flat surface of any solid or liquid, she can take normal actions and make normal attacks, and can move at her normal speed (she can even "run" at four times her normal speed). However, at distances higher than 1 foot above any surface, her speed diminishes to 10 feet per round.

While she remains within 1 foot of a surface, she can make melee and ranged attacks normally, but if she moves any higher, she incurs the penalties on melee and ranged attack rolls as if she were the subject of the *psionic levitate* power.

### Sidestep Charge (Ex)
At 1st level, an elocater gains Sidestep Charge as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If the character already has this feat, she gains no benefit.

### Opportunistic Strike (Ex)
Beginning at 2nd level, an elocater's hyperawareness of spatial relations gives her an instinctive view of the battlefield, which allows her to make a cunning attack against distracted opponents. The elocater gains a +2 insight bonus on her attack roll and her damage roll (if the attack hits) for the first attack she makes against an opponent that has been dealt damage in melee by another character since the elocater's last action. At 5th level the insight bonus increases to +4, and at 8th level the insight bonus increases to +6.

### Dimension Step (Su)
An elocater of 3rd level or higher can slip psionically between spaces as if using the *psionic dimension door* power, once per day. The elocater cannot bring any other creatures with her. Her manifester level for this effect is equal to her elocater level.

### Flanker (Ex)
An elocater of 4th level or higher can flank enemies from seemingly impossible angles. She can designate any adjacent square as the square from which flanking against an ally is determined (including the square where she stands, as normal). She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for flanking until she is no longer adjacent to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character can even choose a square that is impassable or occupied.

### Transporter (Ex)
At 6th level, an elocater learns both *psionic teleport* and *psionic plane shift*. These powers are in addition to any powers the elocater normally learns by advancing a level.

The elocater treats these powers as if they were 3rd-level powers on her class list. This means, among other things, that manifesting these powers costs 5 power points. (If the character does not have a high enough manifester level to manifest 3rd-level powers the character cannot manifest these powers until she has attained the required manifester level.)

### Capricious Step (Ex)
At 7th level, an elocater can take an extra 5-foot step in any round when she doesn't perform any other movement (except for the first 5-foot step). Like the first, the second 5-foot step does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character can take the extra 5-foot step immediately after taking the first, or wait until the end of her other actions for the round. In all other ways, the rules for taking a 5-foot step apply.

### Dimension Spring Attack (Su)
An elocater of 9th level or higher can use her dimension step ability in conjunction with her Spring Attack feat once per day. This ability can be used only against opponents within 60 feet to which the elocater has line of sight. She can dimension step up to the target, use Spring Attack, and then use dimension step to return to her starting point. (When she uses this ability, the total distance she can travel before and after the attack is not limited by her speed.) The use of this ability counts as her use of the dimension step ability on that day (and this ability is not available during a day when she has already used dimension step).

### Accelerated Action (Su)
When she attains 10th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can choose to parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects that provide additional actions, such as *schism* or a *haste* spell---and in fact an elocater can't take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)

If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is holding. The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. If the elocater uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30 feet. The elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a power in the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard action or shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 dodge bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Any condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes her lose these dodge bonuses.

: Table: The Psionic Fist

#### Class Features

All the following are class features of the Psionic Fist prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Psionic Fists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

### Monk Abilities
A Psionic Fist's class levels stack with his monk levels for the purpose of determining his unarmed damage and bonuses to Armor Class and unarmored speed. His class levels do not apply to other monk abilities such as flurry of blows, slow fall, and so on.

### Power Points/Day
A Psionic Fist can manifest powers. His ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psionic Fist. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. If a Psionic Fist has power points from a different class, those points are pooled together and usable to manifest powers from either class. Bonus power points from having a high ability score can be gained only for the character's highest psionic class.

### Powers Known
A Psionic Fist chooses his powers from the psychic warrior power list. At 1st level, a Psionic Fist knows one psychic warrior power of your choice. Each time he attains a new level, he learns one new power. A Psionic Fist can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level. The total number of powers a Psionic Fist can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points.

A Psionic Fist simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters pre pare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.

The Difficulty Class for saving throws against Psionic Fist powers is 10 + the power's level + the Psionic Fist's Wisdom modifier.

### Maximum Power Level Known
A Psionic Fist gains the ability to learn one 1st-level power when he takes his first level in the prestige class. As he attains each new odd-numbered level, a Psionic Fist gains the ability to master more complex powers.

To learn or manifest a power, a Psionic Fist must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.

### Bonus Psionic Feat
At 5th and 10th level, a Psionic Fist can take any psionic feat as a bonus feat. He must still meet the prerequisites for the feat.

### Multiclass Note
A monk who becomes a Psionic Fist may continue advancing as a monk.

### Slayer

### Hit Die
d8.

#### Requirements

To qualify to become a slayer, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

### Base Attack Bonus
+4.

### Skill
Knowledge (dungeoneering) 4 ranks.

### Feat

### Psionics
Must have a power point reserve of at least 1 power point.

#### Class Skills

The slayer's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Listen (Wis), Psicraft (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

### Skill Points at Each Level
4 + Int modifier.

: Table: The Slayer

#### Class Features

All the following are class features of the slayer prestige class.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Slayers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all types of armor.

### Powers Known
Beginning at 2nd level, a slayer gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of slayer to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.

If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a slayer, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of slayer for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

If the character did not belong to a manifesting class before taking this prestige class, she does not gain manifesting levels.

### Favored Enemy (Ex)
When she enters the class, a slayer formally declares a type of psionic creature as the enemy she detests above all others. Due to her extensive study of her foes and training in the proper techniques for combating them, she gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against her favored enemy.

Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this kind. At 4th level the bonuses increase to +4, at 7th level to +6, and at 10th level to +8.

### Enemy Sense (Su)
A slayer can sense the presence of her favored enemy within 60 feet of herself, even if they are hidden by darkness or walls, but she cannot discern their exact location.

### Brain Nausea (Su)
At 2nd level, a slayer gains a constant defensive ability somewhat similar to the *aversion* power. Any creature that attempts to eat the slayer's brain must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + slayer's class level) or become disinclined to do so for 24 hours thereafter. A creature that fails this save may take any action it desires except extracting the slayer's brain (but does not realize it is being so affected). This ability is active even if the slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.

### Lucid Buffer (Ex)
At 3rd level, a slayer becomes especially skilled at resisting mental attacks. She gains a +4 competence bonus on saving throws against all compulsions and mind-affecting effects. This ability is active even if the slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.

### Cerebral Blind (Su)
After reaching 6th level, a slayer is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that reveal location. This ability protects against information gathering by clairsentience powers or effects that reveal location.

The ability even foils *bend reality, [[limited wish]], [[miracle]], reality revision,* and *[[wish]]* when they are used to gain information about the slayer's location (however, *metafaculty* can pierce this protective barrier). In the case of *remote viewing* or *[[scrying]]* that scans an area a slayer is in, the effect works, but the slayer simply isn't detected. *Remote viewing* or *[[scrying]]* attempts that are targeted specifically at a slayer do not work. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.

### Breach Power Resistance (Su)
A slayer of 8th level or higher can enhance her weapon with psionic might. Each successful melee attack (or ranged attack if the target is within 30 feet) she makes with her weapon against a creature with power resistance temporarily reduces its power resistance by 1. Unless the creature is slain, its lost power resistance returns all at once 12 hours later. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.

### Cerebral Immunity (Su)
On reaching 9th level, a slayer gains protection from all devices, powers, and spells that influence the mind. This ability shields her against almost all mind-affecting powers and effects (though the slayer can selectively allow powers or spells to affect her). The ability even foils *bend reality*, *[[limited wish]]*, *[[miracle]], reality revision*, and *[[wish]]* when they are used to mentally influence a slayer. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.

### Blast Feedback (Su)
At 10th level, if a slayer makes her saving throw when attacked with *mind blast,* the *mind blast* rebounds upon the attacker. Only the original attacker is targeted in the rebound effect. If the original attacker fails a Will saving throw (DC equal to that of the original attack), the attacker is affected normally by the *mind blast.*
