Bugbears speak Goblin and Common.

COMBAT

Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents whenever possible. When hunting, they normally send scouts ahead of the main group that, if they spy prey, return to report and bring up reinforcements.

Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant.


**Skills:** Bugbears have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.


**BUGBEARS AS CHARACTERS**


Bugbear characters possess the following racial traits.
