## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of acid. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. The black dragon's breath weapon deals 18d4 acid damage. Creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves (DC 30) to take half damage.

Water Breathing (Ex): The dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

Corrupt Water (Sp): Once per day the dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul, and unable to support animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed at a Will save (DC 27) or become fouled.

Other Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day - darkness (radius 90 feet); 1/day - plant growth.
