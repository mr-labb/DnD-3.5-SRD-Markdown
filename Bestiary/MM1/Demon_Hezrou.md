## Description



Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it - even other demons.

A hezrou can walk both upright and on all fours, but it always fights standing up

A hezrou is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 750 pounds.

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

Hezrous enjoy melee combat even more than vrocks do. They eagerly press an attack deep into the heart of enemy forces, so their stench can take effect as quickly as possible. They enter most battles by using *[[blasphemy]],* and follow it with an occasional *[[chaos hammer]]* or *[[unholy blight]],* depending on the alignment of their opponents.

A hezrou's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a hezrou must hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[chaos hammer]]* (DC 18), *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *[[unholy blight]]* (DC 18); 3/day - *[[blasphemy]]* (DC 21), *[[Compendium/Spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]].* Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Stench (Ex):** A hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A *[[delay poison]]* or *[[neutralize poison]]* spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**
*Summon Demon* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day a hezrou can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or another hezrou with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.


**Skills:** Hezrous have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
