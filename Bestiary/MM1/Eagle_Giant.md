## Description

<p>A typical giant eagle stands about 10 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way except size. It weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>Giant eagles speak Common and Auran.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its powerful talons and slashing beak to strike at its target's head and eyes.</p>
<p>A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not appear threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making repeated diving attacks to drive away intruders, and fights to the death to defend their nest or hatchlings.</p>
<p>
            <b>Evasion (Ex):</b> With a successful Reflex save against an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant eagle takes no damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Giant eagles have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
<p>TRAINING A GIANT EAGLE</p>
<p>Although intelligent, a giant eagle requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant eagle must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant eagle requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.</p>
<p>Riding a giant eagle requires an exotic saddle. A giant eagle can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p>
<p>Giant eagle eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant eagle.</p>
<p>Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant eagle is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.</p>
