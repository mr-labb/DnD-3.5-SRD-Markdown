## Description



These great cats stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds.

Combat


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a tiger must hit with a claw or bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a tiger charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d8+3.


**Skills:** Tigers have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.
