Boon Foot soldiers can help PCs buy normal (nonmasterwork) simple or martial weapons at a 10% discount, or may agree to accompany the PCs as men-at-arms for a 10% share of the treasure.

 


<u>DESCRIPTION</u>


Foot soldiers are the backbone of any army, stout soldiers who “hold the line” in the face of the enemy’s charge with a bristling wall of pikes, decimate an opposing force’s ranks with a hail of javelins, or hew with their swords in the bloody grind of close combat. Foot soldiers close the gap when their foes try to flee the field, and are tough enough to shrug off blows that would fell a common man.
