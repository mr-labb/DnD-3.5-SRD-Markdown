## Description

<p>Belkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are composed primarily of smoke. Although undeniably evil, they are very reclusive and usually have no interest in the affairs of others. A belker's winged shape makes it look distinctly demonic. It is about 7 feet long and weighs about 8 pounds.</p>
<p>Belkers speak Auran.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws and painful bite.</p>
<p>
            <b>Smoke Claws (Ex):</b> A belker in smoke form (see below) can engulf opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air around one Medium or smaller opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke inside the victim solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. An affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace.</p>
<p>
            <b>Smoke Form (Su):</b> Most of the time a belker is more or less solid, but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. A belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect). The ability is otherwise similar to a <i>gaseous form</i> spell (caster level 7th).</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Belkers have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
