## Description



Constrictor snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted. They hunt for food but do not attempt to make a meal out of any creature that is too large to constrict.

Snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted.

Combat

Constrictor snakes hunt by grabbing prey with their mouths and then squeezing it with their powerful bodies.


**Constrict (Ex):** On a successful grapple check, a constrictor snake deals 1d3+4 points of damage.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a constrictor snake must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Skills:** Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A snake can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. Snakes use either their Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher. A snake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
