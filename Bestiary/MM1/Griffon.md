## Description

<p>Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures with the characteristics of both lions and eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature's back and span 25 feet or more. A griffon weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>A griffon cannot speak, but understands Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack or leaping from above.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a griffon dives upon or charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +8 melee, damage 1d6+2.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Griffons have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Spot checks.</p>
<p>TRAINING A GRIFFON</p>
<p>Although intelligent, a griffon requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a griffon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly griffon requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle. A griffon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p>
<p>Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a griffon.</p>
<p>Carrying Capacity: A light load for a griffon is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.</p>
