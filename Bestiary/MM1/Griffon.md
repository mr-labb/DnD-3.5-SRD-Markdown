## Description



Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures with the characteristics of both lions and eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature's back and span 25 feet or more. A griffon weighs about 500 pounds.

A griffon cannot speak, but understands Common.

COMBAT

Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack or leaping from above.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a griffon dives upon or charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +8 melee, damage 1d6+2.


**Skills:** Griffons have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Spot checks.

TRAINING A GRIFFON

Although intelligent, a griffon requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a griffon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly griffon requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle. A griffon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a griffon.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a griffon is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.
