level_adjustment: About the size of an adult human, this dragonlike creature bears distinctly lupine features in place of the more common feline attributes of traditional dragons. Its jaw is elongated and its build muscular, although its wings seem stunted for its size. Most creatures perceive ambush drakes as deadly draconic hunters of limited intelligence. However, they are social creatures among their own kind. Ambush drakes share the classic dragon mentality of hoarding treasure, but a pack doesn’t believe in individual ownership. While one ambush drake might use an item at any given moment, the pack owns the treasure, and tomorrow another ambush drake might use it.\nAn ambush drake prefers to move about on all fours, only using its undersized wings when necessary. An ambush drake typically weighs 200 pounds and has a 5-foot-long body. Its scales display dark shades of gray or black.\nAmbush drakes can speak Common and Draconic, but rarely choose to do so. Instead, they communicate telepathically with their kind

## Description



Ambush drakes generally stalk their prey as a coordinated pack. They start by using their breath weapons and focus attacks on affected creatures, ignoring quicker fleeing prey.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** 30-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, slow (duration 7 rounds),Will DC 17 negates. Ambush drakes are immune to the breath weapons of other ambush drakes. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Telepathic Link (Ex):** Ambush drakes share a communal consciousness, enabling them to communicate telepathically with other ambush drakes. A group of ambush drakes within 30 feet of each other are in constant contact. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in the group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No ambush drake in the group is considered flanked unless all are.


**Pack Tactics :** The drake has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the drake's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.


**Surprise Attack :** If the drake surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.
