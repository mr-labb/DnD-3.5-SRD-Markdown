## Description

<p>Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.</p>
<p>All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.</p>
<p>Fire mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
<p>A fire mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound.</p>
<p>Fire mephits speak Common and Ignan.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.</p>
<p>A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Mephit</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a <i>summon monster</i> spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 15-foot cone, damage 1d8 fire, Reflex half DC 12. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial adjustment.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/hour - <i>scorching ray</i> (DC 14) as the spell cast by a 3rd-level sorcerer; 1/day - <i>heat metal</i> (DC 14). Caster level 6th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> A fire mephit heals only if it is touching a flame at least as large as a torch.</p>
