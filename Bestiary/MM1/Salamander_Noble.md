Salamanders speak Ignan. Some average salamanders and all nobles also speak Common.

COMBAT

If a salamander has damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Constrict (Ex):** A salamander deals automatic tail slap damage (including fire damage) with a successful grapple check. A noble salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided they are all at least two sizes smaller than it.


**Heat (Ex):** A salamander generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Salamanders' metallic weapons also conduct this heat.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a salamander must hit a creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** (Noble salamanders only) 3/day - *[[burning hands]]* (DC 13), *fireball* (DC 15), *[[flaming sphere]]* (DC 14), *[[wall of fire]]* (DC 16); 1/day - *[[dispel magic]], [[summon monster VII]]* (Huge fire elemental). Caster level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Skills:** Salamanders have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (blacksmithing) checks.


**Feats:** Salamanders have the Multiattack feat even though they do not have the requisite three natural weapons.
