## Description

<p>Archons are celestials from a lawful good-aligned plane.</p>
<p>Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.</p>
<p>Hound archons look like well-muscled humans with canine heads.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).</p>
<p>
            <b>Archon Traits:</b> An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Hound archons prefer to attack with their natural weapons but occasionally use greatswords.</p>
<p>A hound archon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>aid, continual flame, detect evil, message.</i> Caster level 6th.</p>

While in canine form, the hound archon loses its bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite attack of the form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any doglike or wolflike animal of the animal type.</p>
<p>

<p>
            <b>HOUND ARCHON HERO</b>
          </p>
<p>The hound archon hero is a mighty champion of justice, devoted to the pursuit and destruction of evil in all its forms.</p>

<p>HOUND ARCHON HERO MOUNTS</p>
<p>In the course of their adventures, many hound archon heroes befriend bronze dragons, which may come to serve as their mounts. The relationship between these mounts and their celestial riders goes beyond even the special bond between paladin and mount. The dragon and the archon are naturally allies and friends, as can be expected of two powerful servants of cosmic justice. The juvenile bronze dragon mount gains 2 additional HD, 4 points of Strength, an additional 4 points of natural armor, improved evasion, and +10 feet to speed in all its movement forms. The dragon cannot, however, command other creatures of its type as other kinds of paladin mounts can.</p>
