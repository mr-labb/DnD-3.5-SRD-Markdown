## Description



Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned Outer Planes.

Angels can be of any good alignment. Regardless of their alignment, angels never lie, cheat, or steal. They are impeccably honorable in all their dealings and often prove the most trustworthy and diplomatic of all the celestials.

All angels are blessed with comely looks, though their actual appearances vary widely.

Angels speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, though they can speak with almost any creature because of their [[tongues]] ability.

An astral deva is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.


**Combat**


In combat, most angels make full use of their mobility and their ability to attack at a distance.


**Angel Traits:** An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

An astral deva is not afraid to enter melee combat. It takes a fierce joy in bashing evil foes with its powerful *+3 heavy mace of disruption.*

An astral deva's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[aid]], [[continual flame]], [[detect evil]], [[discern lies]]* (DC 19), *[[dispel evil]]* (DC 20), *[[dispel magic]], [[holy aura]]* (DC 23), *[[holy smite]]* (DC 19), *[[holy word]]* (DC 22), *[[invisibility]]* (self only), *[[plane shift]]* (DC 22), *[[polymorph]]* (self only), *[[remove curse]]* (DC 18), *[[remove disease]]* (DC 18), *[[remove fear]]* (DC 16); 7/day - *[[cure light wounds]]* (DC 16), *[[see invisibility]];* 1/day - *[[blade barrier]]* (DC 21), *[[heal]]* (DC 21). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Stun (Su):** If an astral deva strikes an opponent twice in one round with its mace, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.


**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** An astral deva retains its Dexterity bonus to AC when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked except by a rogue of at least 16th level. It can flank characters with the uncanny dodge ability as if it were a 12th-level rogue.
