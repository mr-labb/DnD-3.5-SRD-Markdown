Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite).

All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher also speak Common.

COMBAT

Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive two-handed weapons and wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant's favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.

Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells.


**Rock Throwing (Ex):** Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to five range increments. The size of the range increment varies with the giant's variety. A Huge giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects). The range increment is 140 feet for a cloud giant's thrown rocks.


**Rock Catching (Ex):** A giant of at least Large size can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).

Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready for and aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.


**Oversized Weapon (Ex):** A cloud giant wields a great, two-handed morningstar (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day - *[[levitate]]* (self plus 2,000 pounds), *[[obscuring mist]]* ; 1/day - *[[fog cloud]]* . Caster level 15th.
