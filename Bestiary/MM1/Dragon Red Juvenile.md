## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A red dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of fire (8d10 damage, Reflex save for half damage DC 22). Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If the dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Fire Subtype (Ex): Fire immunity, double damage from cold except on a successful save.

Locate Object (Sp): The dragon can use this ability as the spell of the same name, 4 times per day.
