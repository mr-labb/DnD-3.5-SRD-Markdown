## Description

<p>The statistics presented here describe a small horse, under 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Ponies are otherwise similar to light horses and cannot fight while carrying a rider.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>*A pony not trained for war does not normally use its hooves to attack but rather to run. Its hoof attack is treated as a secondary attack and adds only half the pony's Strength bonus to damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a pony is up to 75 pounds; a medium load, 76-150 pounds; and a heavy load, 151-225 pounds. A pony can drag 1,125 pounds.</p>
