## Description



The statistics presented here describe a small horse, under 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Ponies are otherwise similar to light horses and cannot fight while carrying a rider.

Combat

*A pony not trained for war does not normally use its hooves to attack but rather to run. Its hoof attack is treated as a secondary attack and adds only half the pony's Strength bonus to damage.


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a pony is up to 75 pounds; a medium load, 76-150 pounds; and a heavy load, 151-225 pounds. A pony can drag 1,125 pounds.
