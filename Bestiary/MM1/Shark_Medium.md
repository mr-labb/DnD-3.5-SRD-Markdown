## Description

<p>These carnivorous fish are aggressive and liable to make unprovoked attacks against anything that approaches them. Smaller sharks are from 5 to 8 feet long and not usually dangerous to creatures other than their prey. Large sharks can reach around 15 feet in length and are a serious threat. Huge sharks are true monsters, like great whites, that can exceed 20 feet in length.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Sharks circle and observe potential prey, then dart in and bite with their powerful jaws.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> A shark can locate creatures underwater within a 30-foot radius. This ability works only when the shark is underwater.</p>
<p>
            <b>Keen Scent (Ex):</b> A shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
