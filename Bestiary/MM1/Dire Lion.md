## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>Dire lions are patient hunters, just like their smaller cousins, but apt to take on bigger prey.</p>
<p>Dire lions grow to be up to 15 feet long and weigh up to 3,500 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A dire lion attacks by running at prey, leaping, and clawing and biting as it rakes with its rear claws. It often jumps onto a creature larger than itself.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a dire lion must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a dire lion charges, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +12 melee, damage 1d6+3.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Dire lions have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>*In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.</p>
