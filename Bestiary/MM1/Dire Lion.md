Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.

Dire lions are patient hunters, just like their smaller cousins, but apt to take on bigger prey.

Dire lions grow to be up to 15 feet long and weigh up to 3,500 pounds.

Combat

A dire lion attacks by running at prey, leaping, and clawing and biting as it rakes with its rear claws. It often jumps onto a creature larger than itself.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a dire lion must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a dire lion charges, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +12 melee, damage 1d6+3.


**Skills:** Dire lions have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

*In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.
