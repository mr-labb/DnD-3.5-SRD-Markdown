## Description

<p>Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest.</p>
<p>Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.</p>
<p>Most elves encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information presented here is for one of 1st level.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Elves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their opponents and the location of the fight if at all possible, maximizing their advantage by using ambushes, snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from cover and retreat before they are found, repeating this maneuver until all of their enemies are dead.</p>
<p>They prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and longswords. In melee, elves are graceful and deadly, using complex maneuvers that are beautiful to observe. Their wizards often use <i>sleep</i> spells during combat because these won't affect other elves.</p>
<p>
            <b>Elf Traits (Ex):</b> Elves possess the following racial traits.</p>
<p>The elf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
<p>
            <b>Drow</b>
          </p>
<p>Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot.</p>
<p>White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and thinner than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are often a vivid red.</p>
<p>Drow usually coat their arrows with a potent venom.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> An opponent hit by a drow's poisoned weapon must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. After 1 minute, the subject must succeed on another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours. A typical drow carries 1d4-1 doses of drow knockout poison. Drow typically coat arrows and crossbow bolts with this poison, but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. Note that drow have no special ability to apply poison without risking being poisoned themselves. Since this poison is not a magical effect, drow and other elves are susceptible to it.</p>
<p>
            <b>Drow Traits (Ex):</b> These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, except where noted.</p>
<p>The drow warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
<p>Challenge Rating: Drow with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level. Drow with levels in PC classes have a CR equal to their character level +1.</p>
