A dragonne possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, usually the color of its scales. A dragonne is about 12 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.

Dragonnes speak Draconic.

COMBAT

A dragonne's wings are useful only for short flights, carrying the creature for 10 to 30 minutes at a time. Nevertheless, it uses its wings effectively in battle. If opponents attempt to charge or encircle it, the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more defensible position.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a dragonne charges, it can make a full attack in the same round.


**Roar (Su):** A dragonne can loose a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds. All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves become exhausted. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Skills:** Dragonnes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a dragonne is up to 348 pounds; a medium load, 349-699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700-1,050 pounds.
