## Description

<p>A dragonne possesses huge claws and fangs, and large eyes, usually the color of its scales. A dragonne is about 12 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.</p>
<p>Dragonnes speak Draconic.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A dragonne's wings are useful only for short flights, carrying the creature for 10 to 30 minutes at a time. Nevertheless, it uses its wings effectively in battle. If opponents attempt to charge or encircle it, the dragonne simply takes to the air and finds a more defensible position.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a dragonne charges, it can make a full attack in the same round.</p>
<p>
            <b>Roar (Su):</b> A dragonne can loose a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds. All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves become exhausted. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Dragonnes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a dragonne is up to 348 pounds; a medium load, 349-699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700-1,050 pounds.</p>
