A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk's body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature weighs about 300 pounds.

COMBAT

A basilisk relies on its gaze attack, biting only when opponents come within reach. Though it has eight legs, its slow metabolism renders it relatively sluggish, so it does not expend energy unnecessarily. Intruders who flee a basilisk rather than fight can expect, at best, a halfhearted pursuit. These creatures tend to spend most of their time lying in wait for prey, which includes small mammals, birds, reptiles, and similar creatures.


            **Petrifying Gaze (Su):** Turn to stone permanently, range 30 feet; Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.


            **Skills:** *The basilisk's dull coloration and its ability to remain motionless for long periods of time grant it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in natural settings.


            **ABYSSAL GREATER BASILISK**
          

COMBAT

The save DC for the abyssal greater basilisk's petrifying gaze (DC 21) is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and higher Charisma score.

An abyssal greater basilisk's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


            **Smite Good (Su):** Once per day an abyssal greater basilisk can make a normal melee attack to deal an extra 18 points of damage against a good foe.
