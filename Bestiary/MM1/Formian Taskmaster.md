## Description

<p>A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.</p>
<p>
            <b>TASKMASTER</b>
          </p>
<p>These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance from the mental energies of those they dominate.</p>
<p>A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all possible. If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with claws and a poison sting.</p>
<p>A formian taskmaster's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Dominate Monster (Su):</b> A taskmaster can use a <i>dominate monster</i> ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates), although the subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same taskmaster's dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A single taskmaster can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Dominated Creature (Ex):</b> A taskmaster is never encountered alone. One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or determine randomly any creature of CR 4).</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
