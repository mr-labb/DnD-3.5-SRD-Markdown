## Description






Copper dragons appreciate wit and don't usually harm creatures who can relate a joke, humorous story or riddle they have not heard before. They quickly get annoyed with anyone who doesn't laugh at their jokes or accept their tricks with good humor. They like to taunt and annoy opponents into up or acting foolishly.

An angry copper dragon prefers to mire foes using transmute rock to mud. The dragon pushes trapped opponents into the mud or snatches and carries them aloft. A copper dragon tries to draw airborne enemies into narrow stony gorges where it can use its spider climb ability and maneuver them into colliding with the walls.

Breath Weapon (Su): A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid (22d4 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 34) or a cone of slow gas. Creatures within the must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 34) or be slowed for 1d6 rounds plus 11 rounds. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 330 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (35).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 33) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
