## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid (2d4 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 13) or a cone of slow gas. Creatures within the must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 13) or be slowed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.
