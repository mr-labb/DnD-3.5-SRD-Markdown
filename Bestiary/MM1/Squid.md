## Description

<p>These free-swimming mollusks are fairly aggressive. They are more feared than sharks in some locales.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a squid must hit an opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and automatically deals bite damage. *A squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ink Cloud (Ex):</b> A squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.</p>
<p>
            <b>Jet (Ex):</b> A squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line</p>
