Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

A barbed devil is about 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.


**Devil Traits:** Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

Barbed devils eagerly fight with their claws, trying to impale their opponents. They use *[[hold person]]* to immobilize those who avoid their hug attacks.

A barbed devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Fear (Su):** A creature hit by a barbed devil must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as though by *fear* (caster level 9th).

Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that same barbed devil's fear ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Impale (Ex):** A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a barbed devil must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent on its barbed body.


**
*Summon Devil* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day a barbed devil can attempt to summon 1d6 bearded devils or another barbed devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.


**Barbed Defense (Su):** Any creature striking a barbed devil with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes 1d8+6 points of piercing and slashing damage from the devil's barbs. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *[[hold person]]* (DC 16), *[[major image]]* (DC 17), *[[scorching ray]]* (2 rays only). 1/day - *[[Orders Wrath|order's wrath]]* (DC 18), *[[unholy blight]]* (DC 18). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
