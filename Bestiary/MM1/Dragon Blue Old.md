## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning (Reflex save DC 29 for half damage), damage 16d8. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If the dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 240 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (27).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 27) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.

Create/Destroy Water (Sp): The dragon can use this ability three times per day It works like the create water spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed at a will save (DC 27) or be ruined.
