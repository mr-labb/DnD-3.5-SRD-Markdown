Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

Unlike other devils, erinyes appear attractive to humans, resembling very comely women or men. An erinyes stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.

Erinyes speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.


**Devil Traits:** Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

Erinyes prefer to engage in combat from a distance. They use *[[charm monster]]* to distract or disorganize their opponents, then rain down fiery arrows from above.

An erinyes's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Entangle (Ex):** Each erinyes carries a stout rope some 50 feet long that entangles opponents of any size as an *[[animate rope]]* spell (caster level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty. Typically, an erinyes entangles a foe, lifts it into the air, and drops it from a great height.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *[[charm monster]]* (DC 19), *[[minor image]]* (DC 17), *[[unholy blight]]* (DC 19). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**
*Summon Devil* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day an erinyes can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d4 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.


**[[True Seeing]] (Su):** Erinyes continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).
