## Description

<p>This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth. Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator among subterranean inhabitants.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an open space where it has a better chance .</p>
<p>
            <b>Greater Invisibility (Su):</b> This ability is constant, allowing a phantom fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like <i>greater invisibility</i> (caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell. A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute after it is killed.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
