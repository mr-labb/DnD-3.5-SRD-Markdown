This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster of nodules atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A cluster of nodules atop the main mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and attacks with a gaping maw lined with rows of teeth. Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it to move about. This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared predator among subterranean inhabitants.

COMBAT

A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks lone individuals almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an open space where it has a better chance .


**[[Invisibility Greater|Greater Invisibility]] (Su):** This ability is constant, allowing a phantom fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like *[[Invisibility Greater|greater invisibility]]* (caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the phantom fungus is alive. This ability is not subject to the *[[invisibility purge]]* spell. A phantom fungus becomes visible 1 minute after it is killed.


**Skills:** A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.
