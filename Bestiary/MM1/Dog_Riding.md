## Description



This category includes working breeds such as collies, huskies, and St. Bernards.


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a riding dog is up to 100 pounds; a medium load, 101-200 pounds; and a heavy load, 201-300 pounds. A riding dog can drag 1,500 pounds.

Combat

If trained for war, these animals can make trip attacks just as wolves do (see the [[Wolf]] entry). A riding dog can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.


**Skills:** Riding dogs have a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks. *Riding dogs have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by [[Scent]].
