## Description

<p>An adult grick is about 8 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the end of its body and weighs some 200 pounds. Its body coloration is uniformly dark, with a pale underbelly.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Gricks attack when hungry or threatened. They hunt by holing up near high-traffic areas, using their natural coloration to blend into convenient shadows. When prey (virtually anything that moves) ventures near, they lash out with their tentacles. A grick's rubbery body seems to shed blows of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small and weak compared to its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately, a grick normally drags its victim back to its lair to be eaten at its leisure.</p>
<p>A grick's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>Multiple gricks do not fight in concert. Each attacks the prey closest to it, and breaks off the fight as soon as it can drag dead or unconscious prey away.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A grick has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
<p>*Their coloration affords gricks a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when in natural rocky areas.</p>
