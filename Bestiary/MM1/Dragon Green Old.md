## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A green dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of corrosive (acid) gas (Reflex save for half damage DC 26) 14d6 acid damage. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Water Breathing (Ex): The dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.
