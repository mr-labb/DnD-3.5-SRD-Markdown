## Description



Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

An ice devil is about 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.


**Devil Traits:** Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

An ice devil prefers to fight only when doing so serves its mission, but it never hesitates to attack when it deems a battle necessary - or likely to end in its victory.

An ice devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Fear Aura (Su):** An ice devil can radiate a 10-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 13th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ice devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Slow (Su):** A hit from an ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a *slow* spell for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[cone of cold]]* (DC 20), *fly, [[ice storm]]* (DC 19), *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *[[persistent image]]* (DC 20), *[[unholy aura]]* (DC 23), *[[wall of ice]]* (DC 19). Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**
*Summon Devil* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day an ice devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils, 2d4 bone devils with a 50% chance of success, or another ice devil with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.


**[[Regeneration]] (Ex):** An ice devil takes normal damage from good-aligned weapons and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.
