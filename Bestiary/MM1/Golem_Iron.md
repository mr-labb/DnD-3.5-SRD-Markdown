## Description

<p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces.</p>
<p>The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.</p>
<p>This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.</p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem's body includes costly material components that may require some extra preparation. The golem's creator can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate skill, which varies with the golem variety.</p>
<p>Completing the golem's creation drains the appropriate XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.</p>
<p>The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>
<p>The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem's description.</p>
<p>
            <i>Note:</i> The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem's market price minus the cost of the special materials required.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.</p>
<p>A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem's creator can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else's control, and so on), but the golem's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 10-foot cube, cloud of poisonous gas lasting 1 round, free action once every 1d4+1 rounds; initial damage 1d4 Con, secondary damage 3d4 Con, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted. An iron golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, an iron golem hit by a <i>fireball</i> gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 18 points. An iron golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.</p>
<p>An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a <i>rusting grasp</i> spell.</p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>An iron golem's body is sculpted from 5,000 pounds of pure iron, smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures costing at least 10,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 20 Craft (armorsmithing) check or a DC 20 Craft (weaponsmithing) check.</p>
<p>CL 16th; Craft Construct, <i>cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object</i>, caster must be at least 16th level<i>;</i> Price 150,000 gp; Cost 80,000 gp + 5,600 XP.</p>
