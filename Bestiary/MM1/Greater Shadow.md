A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places.

A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak intelligibly.

COMBAT

Shadows lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by.


**Strength Damage (Su):** The touch of a shadow deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living foe. A creature reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow dies. This is a negative energy effect.


**Create Spawn (Su):** Any humanoid reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow becomes a shadow under the control of its killer within 1d4 rounds.


**Skills:** Shadows have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks and a +4 racial bonus on Search checks. *A shadow gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in areas of shadowy illumination. In brightly lit areas, it takes a -4 penalty on Hide checks.


**GREATER SHADOW**


Although no more intelligent than an average shadow, a greater shadow is more fearsome because of its increased damage and its hit-and-run tactics.

COMBAT


**Strength Damage (Su):** The touch of a greater shadow deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to a living foe.
