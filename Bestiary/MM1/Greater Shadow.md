## Description

<p>A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places.</p>
<p>A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak intelligibly.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Shadows lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by.</p>
<p>
            <b>Strength Damage (Su):</b> The touch of a shadow deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living foe. A creature reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow dies. This is a negative energy effect.</p>
<p>
            <b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Any humanoid reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow becomes a shadow under the control of its killer within 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Shadows have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks and a +4 racial bonus on Search checks. *A shadow gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in areas of shadowy illumination. In brightly lit areas, it takes a -4 penalty on Hide checks.</p>
<p>
            <b>GREATER SHADOW</b>
          </p>
<p>Although no more intelligent than an average shadow, a greater shadow is more fearsome because of its increased damage and its hit-and-run tactics.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>
            <b>Strength Damage (Su):</b> The touch of a greater shadow deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to a living foe.</p>
