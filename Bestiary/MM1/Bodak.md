## Description



Bodaks are the undead remnants of humanoids who have been destroyed by the touch of absolute evil.

A bodak retains fleeting memories of its past life and can speak Common (or some other humanoid language).

COMBAT


**Death Gaze (Su):** Death, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. Humanoids who die from this attack are transformed into bodaks 24 hours later. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):** Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its merest touch burns their impure flesh. Each round of exposure to the direct rays of the sun deals 1 point of damage to the creature.
