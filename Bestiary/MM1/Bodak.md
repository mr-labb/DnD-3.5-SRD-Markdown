## Description

<p>Bodaks are the undead remnants of humanoids who have been destroyed by the touch of absolute evil.</p>
<p>A bodak retains fleeting memories of its past life and can speak Common (or some other humanoid language).</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>
            <b>Death Gaze (Su):</b> Death, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. Humanoids who die from this attack are transformed into bodaks 24 hours later. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):</b> Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its merest touch burns their impure flesh. Each round of exposure to the direct rays of the sun deals 1 point of damage to the creature.</p>
