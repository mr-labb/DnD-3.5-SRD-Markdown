## Description

<p>Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.</p>
<p>Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders, tinkers, or adventurers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin.</p>
<p>Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Gnomes prefer misdirection and deception over direct confrontation.</p>
<p>They would rather befuddle or embarrass foes (other than goblinoids or kobolds) than kill them.</p>
<p>Gnomes make heavy use of illusion magic and carefully prepared ambushes and traps whenever they can.</p>
