## Description



This category includes fairly large, carnivorous lizards from 3 to 5 feet long.

Combat

Monitor lizards can be aggressive, using their powerful jaws to tear at prey or enemies.


**Skills:** A monitor lizard has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Monitor lizards have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. *In forested or overgrown areas, the Hide bonus improves to +8.
