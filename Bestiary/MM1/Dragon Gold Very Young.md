## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A gold dragon has two forms of breath weapon, a cone of fire (4d10 damage, Reflex save for half damage DC 18) or a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the latter must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or take 2 points of temporary Strength damage. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If the dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Alternate Form(Su): A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. A dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it wishes to assume a new one or return to its natural form. A true seeing spell or ability reveals the creature's natural form. A creature using alternate form reverts to its natural form when killed, but separated body parts retain their shape. A creature cannot use alternate form to take the form of a creature with a template.

Fire Subtype (Ex): Fire immunity, double damage from cold except on a successful save.

Water Breathing (Ex): The dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone of superheated steam underwater).
