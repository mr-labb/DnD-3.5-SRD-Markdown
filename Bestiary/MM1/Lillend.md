A typical lillend's coils are 20 feet long. The creature weighs about 3,800 pounds. A few lillends have male torsos.

Lillends speak Celestial, Infernal, Abyssal, and Common.

COMBAT

Lillends are generally peaceful unless they intend vengeance against someone they believe guilty of harming, or even threatening, a favored art form, artwork, or artist. Then they become implacable foes. They use their spells and spell-like abilities to confuse and weaken opponents before entering combat. A covey of lillends usually discusses strategy before a battle.

A lillend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Constrict (Ex):** A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a successful grapple check. Constricting uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it cannot take any move actions when constricting, though it can still attack with its sword.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a lillend must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Spells:** A lillend casts arcane spells as a 6th-level bard.


*Typical Bard Spells Known* (3/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level): 0 - *[[dancing lights]], [[daze]], [[detect magic]], [[lullaby]], [[mage hand]], [[read magic]];* 1st - *[[charm person]], [[cure light wounds]], identify, sleep;* 2nd - *[[hold person]], invisibility, [[sound burst]].*


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day - *[[darkness]], hallucinatory terrain* (DC 18), *[[knock]], light;* 1/day - *[[charm person]]* (DC 15), *[[speak with animals]], [[speak with plants]]* . Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

A lillend also has the bardic music ability as a 6th-level bard.


**Skills:** Lillends have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks.
