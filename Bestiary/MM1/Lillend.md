## Description

<p>A typical lillend's coils are 20 feet long. The creature weighs about 3,800 pounds. A few lillends have male torsos.</p>
<p>Lillends speak Celestial, Infernal, Abyssal, and Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Lillends are generally peaceful unless they intend vengeance against someone they believe guilty of harming, or even threatening, a favored art form, artwork, or artist. Then they become implacable foes. They use their spells and spell-like abilities to confuse and weaken opponents before entering combat. A covey of lillends usually discusses strategy before a battle.</p>
<p>A lillend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a successful grapple check. Constricting uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it cannot take any move actions when constricting, though it can still attack with its sword.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a lillend must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> A lillend casts arcane spells as a 6th-level bard.</p>
<p>
            <i>Typical Bard Spells Known</i> (3/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level): 0 -  <i>dancing lights, daze, detect magic, lullaby, mage hand, read magic;</i> 1st -  <i>charm person,  cure light wounds, identify, sleep;</i> 2nd - <i>hold person, invisibility, sound burst.</i></p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>darkness, hallucinatory terrain</i> (DC 18), <i>knock, light;</i> 1/day - <i>charm person</i> (DC 15), <i>speak with animals, speak with plants</i>. Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>A lillend also has the bardic music ability as a 6th-level bard.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Lillends have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks.</p>
