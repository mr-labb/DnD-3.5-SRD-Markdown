## Description

<p>A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any other creature or object. A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory organs. In this form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack with a pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds.</p>
<p>Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to retreat, parley, or attack, as its fancy strikes.</p>
<p>If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome creature it knows and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some fast or agile form and tries to escape.</p>
<p>
            <b>Amorphous (Ex):</b> A phasm in its natural form has immunity to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject to critical hits and, having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.</p>
<p>
            <b>Resilient (Ex):</b> A phasm has a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves (included in the statistics block).</p>
<p>Alternate Form (Su): A phasm can assume any form of Large size or smaller as a standard action. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself (caster level 15th), except that the phasm does not regain hit points for changing form. A phasm can remain in its alternate form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p>
<p>
            <b>Tremorsense (Ex):</b> A phasm can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground, so long as it is touching the ground itself.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> *When using shapechange, a phasm gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks.</p>
