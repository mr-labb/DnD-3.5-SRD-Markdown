## Description

<p>These vicious little predators lurk underground, grabbing whatever prey happens by. Its hands and feet have spiny pads that help the choker grip almost any surface. The creature weighs about 35 pounds.</p>
<p>Chokers speak Undercommon.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A choker likes to perch near the ceiling, often at intersections, archways, wells, or staircases, and reach down to attack its prey. A choker attacks creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or larger. If one is very hungry, it may attack a group, but it waits to grab the last creature in line.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A choker deals 1d3+3 points of damage with a successful grapple check against a Large or smaller creature. Because it seizes its victim by the neck, a creature in the choker's grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a choker must hit a Large or smaller opponent with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. Chokers receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which is already included in the statistics block.</p>
<p>
            <b>Quickness (Su):</b> Although not particularly dexterous, a choker is supernaturally quick. It can take an extra standard action or move action during its turn each round.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A chokers has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
