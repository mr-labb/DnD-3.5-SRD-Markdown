## Description

<p>A wight's appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of a human.</p>
<p>Wights speak Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Wights attack by hammering with their fists.</p>
<p>
            <b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<p>
            <b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> Living creatures hit by a wight's slam attack gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the wight gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Wights have a +8 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.</p>
