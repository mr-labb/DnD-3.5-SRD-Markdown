Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.

A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.

Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.

These sphinxes are always male. Neither good nor evil, they lack the intelligence of the androsphinx.

Combat

Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx's description provides its attack bonus and damage.

Criosphinxes attack with their claws, as do their kin, but they can also butt with their horns. They don't cast spells and employ only the most simple battle tactics.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d6+3.
