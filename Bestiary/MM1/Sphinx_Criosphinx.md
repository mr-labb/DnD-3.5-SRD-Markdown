## Description

<p>Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.</p>
<p>A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.</p>
<p>Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.</p>
<p>These sphinxes are always male. Neither good nor evil, they lack the intelligence of the androsphinx.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx's description provides its attack bonus and damage.</p>
<p>Criosphinxes attack with their claws, as do their kin, but they can also butt with their horns. They don't cast spells and employ only the most simple battle tactics.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d6+3.</p>
