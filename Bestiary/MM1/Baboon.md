Baboons are powerful and aggressive primates adapted to life on the ground. They prefer open spaces but climb trees to find safe places to rest overnight. A typical baboon is the size of a big dog.

Males can be 2 to 4 feet long and weigh as much as 90 pounds.

Combat

Baboons usually attack in groups.


**Skills:** Baboons have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.
