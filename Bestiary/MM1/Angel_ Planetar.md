## Description

<p>Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned Outer Planes.</p>
<p>Angels can be of any good alignment. Regardless of their alignment, angels never lie, cheat, or steal. They are impeccably honorable in all their dealings and often prove the most trustworthy and diplomatic of all the celestials.</p>
<p>All angels are blessed with comely looks, though their actual appearances vary widely.</p>
<p>Angels speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, though they can speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.</p>
<p>A planetar is nearly 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Combat</b>
          </p>
<p>In combat, most angels make full use of their mobility and their ability to attack at a distance.</p>
<p>
            <b>Angel Traits:</b> An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Despite their vast array of magical powers, planetars are likely to wade into melee with their <i>+3 greatswords.</i> They particularly enjoy fighting fiends.</p>
<p>A planetar's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Regeneration:</b> A planetar takes damage from evil-aligned weapons and from spells and effects with the evil descriptor.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>continual flame, dispel magic, holy smite</i> (DC 20), <i>invisibility</i> (self only), <i>lesser restoration</i> (DC 18), <i>remove curse</i> (DC 19), <i>remove disease</i> (DC 19), <i>remove fear</i> (DC 17), <i>speak with dead</i> (DC 19); 3/day - <i>blade barrier</i> (DC 22), <i>flame strike</i> (DC 21), <i>polymorph</i> (self only), <i>power word stun, raise dead</i>, <i>waves of fatigue</i>; 1/day - <i>earthquake</i> (DC 24), <i>greater restoration</i> (DC 23), <i>mass charm monster</i> (DC 24)<i>, waves of exhaustion</i>. Caster level 17th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>The following abilities are always active on the planetar's person, as the spells (caster level 17th): <i>detect evil, detect snares and pits, discern lies</i> (DC 20),  <i>see invisibility</i>, and <i>true seeing</i>. They can be dispelled, but the planetar can reactivate them as a free action.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> Planetars can cast divine spells as 17th-level clerics. A planetar has access to two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.</p>
