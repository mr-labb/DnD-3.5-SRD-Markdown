## Description






Alternate Form(Su): A silver dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. A dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it wishes to assume a new one or return to its natural form. A true seeing spell or ability reveals the creature's natural form. A creature using alternate form reverts to its natural form when killed, but separated body parts retain their shape. A creature cannot use alternate form to take the form of a creature with a template.

Breath Weapon (Su): A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of cold (14d8 damage, Reflex save for half DC 27) or a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within the latter must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 27) or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 7 rounds. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If the dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Cloudwalking (Su): The dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though ground. The ability functions continuously but can be negated or resumed at will.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 210 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (25).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 27) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
