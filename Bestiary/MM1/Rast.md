## Description

<p>A rast has anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use four at once.</p>
<p>A rast has a body about the size of a large dog's, with a head almost as large as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Rasts paralyze as many of their foes as possible, then attack any that are still moving. A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the same round.</p>
<p>
            <b>Paralyzing Gaze (Su):</b> Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a rast must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.</p>
<p>
            <b>Flight (Su):</b> A rast can cease or resume flight as a free action. A rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action (either a move action or an attack action) each round.</p>
