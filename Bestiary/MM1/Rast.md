## Description



A rast has anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use four at once.

A rast has a body about the size of a large dog's, with a head almost as large as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds.

COMBAT

Rasts paralyze as many of their foes as possible, then attack any that are still moving. A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the same round.


**Paralyzing Gaze (Su):** Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a rast must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.


**Blood Drain (Ex):** A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.


**Flight (Su):** A rast can cease or resume flight as a free action. A rast that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action (either a move action or an attack action) each round.
