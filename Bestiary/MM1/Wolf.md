## Description



Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning.

Combat

A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.


**Trip (Ex):** A wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf.


**Skills:** *Wolves have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by [[Scent]].
