## Description

<p>Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.</p>
<p>
            <b>Trip (Ex):</b> A wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> *Wolves have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.</p>
