## Description



Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

A pit fiend often wraps its wings around itself like a grotesque cloak, and appears wreathed in flames.

A pit fiend is 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.


**Devil Traits:** Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

Pit fiends are wily and resourceful fighters, using *invisibility* to gain the upper hand and biting at foes seemingly able to see them. They don't hesitate to blanket an area with *fireballs* , and can call down the wrath of an inferno with *[[meteor swarm]].*

A pit fiend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Constrict (Ex):** A pit fiend deals 2d8+26 points of damage with a successful grapple check.


**Disease (Su):** A creature struck by a pit fiend's bite attack must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Fear Aura (Su):** A pit fiend can radiate a 20-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be affected as though by a *fear* spell (caster level 18th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same pit fiend's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a pit fiend must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 27, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage death. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[blasphemy]]* (DC 25), *[[create undead]], [[fireball]]* (DC 21), *greater [[dispel magic]], [[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *invisibility, [[magic circle against good]], mass [[hold monster]]* (DC 27), *[[persistent image]]* (DC 23), *[[power word stun]], [[unholy aura]]* (DC 26); 1/day - *[[meteor swarm]]* (DC 27). Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Once per year a pit fiend can use *[[wish]]* as the spell (caster level 20th).


**
*Summon Devil* 
**
**(Sp):** Twice per day a pit fiend can automatically summon 2 lemures, bone devils, or bearded devils, or 1 erinyes, [[Devil_Horned|horned devil]], or [[Devil_Ice|ice devil]]. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.


**[[Regeneration]] (Ex):** A pit fiend takes normal damage from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.

Tactics Round-by-Round

A pit fiend typically opens combat by using its spell-like abilities, attempting to neutralize dangerous opponents before entering melee.


*Prior to combat: [[Unholy aura]]* ; activate fear aura, *summon devil* .


*Round 1:* Quickened *[[fireball]]* and *mass [[hold monster]]* if facing three or more visible, active opponents; otherwise *[[power word stun]]* against unarmored opponent (preferably a spellcaster).


*Round 2: [[Meteor swarm]]* against as many foes as possible, approach worst-injured enemy.


*Round 3:* Full attack against injured enemy.


*Round 4:* Continue melee against injured enemy, or *[[power word stun]]* against annoying spellcaster.


*Round 5:* Repeat from round 1, or *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* to safety if endangered.
