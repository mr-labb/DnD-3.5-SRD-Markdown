## Description

<p>These creatures are similar to badgers but are bigger, stronger, and even more ferocious.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>
            <b>Rage (Ex):</b> A wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a berserk rage on its next turn, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to Armor Class. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Wolverines have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
