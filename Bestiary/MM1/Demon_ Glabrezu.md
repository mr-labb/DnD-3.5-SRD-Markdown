## Description

<p>Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it - even other demons.</p>
<p>Like succubi, glabrezu tempt victims into ruin, but they lure their prey with power or wealth rather than passion.</p>
<p>Glabrezu have penetrating violet eyes, and their skin color ranges from deep russet to pitch black. A glabrezu stands about 15 feet tall and weighs about 5,500 pounds.</p>
<p>Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Glabrezu prefer subterfuge to combat. However, if their attempts to entice or deceive fail, these enormous demons attack with a vengeance. They follow a <i>confusion</i> attack with melee attacks, hoping to finish off wounded foes with <i>chaos hammer</i> or <i>unholy blight.</i></p>
<p>A glabrezu's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a glabrezu must hit a Medium or smaller opponent with a pincer attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>chaos hammer</i> (DC 19), <i>confusion</i> (DC 19), <i>dispel magic, mirror image, reverse gravity</i> (DC 22), <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>unholy blight</i> (DC 19); 1/day - <i>power word stun</i>. Caster level 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>Once per month, a glabrezu can fulfill a <i>wish</i> for a mortal humanoid. The demon can use this ability to offer a mortal whatever he or she desires - but unless the <i>wish</i> is used to create pain and suffering in the world, the glabrezu demands either terrible evil acts or great sacrifice as compensation.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Demon</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a glabrezu can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or 1d2 vrocks with a 50% chance of success, or another glabrezu with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>True Seeing (Su):</b> Glabrezu continuously use true seeing as the spell (caster level 14th).</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Glabrezu have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
