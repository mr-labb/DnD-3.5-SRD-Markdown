## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A white dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of cold (8d6 cold damage, Reflex save for half damage DC 27). Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 240 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (24).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 23) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
