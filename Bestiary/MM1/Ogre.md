## Description

<p>Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor.</p>
<p>Ogres speak Giant, and those specimens who boast Intelligence scores of at least 10 also speak Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Ogres favor overwhelming odds, sneak attacks, and ambushes over a fair fight. They are intelligent enough to fire ranged weapons first to soften up their foes before closing, but ogre gangs and bands fight as unorganized individuals.</p>
<p>
            <b>MERROW</b>
          </p>
<p>These cousins of the ogre have the aquatic subtype.</p>
<p>They dwell in freshwater lakes and rivers. They have a base land speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Instead of the typical ogre's greatclub, they prefer to use longspears in melee (attack +8 melee, damage 1d8+7).</p>
<p>
            <b>OGRES AS CHARACTERS</b>
          </p>
<p>Ogre characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
