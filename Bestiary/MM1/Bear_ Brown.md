## Description

<p>These massive carnivores weigh more than 1,800 pounds and stand nearly 9 feet tall when they rear up on their hind legs. They are bad-tempered and territorial. The brown bear's statistics can be used for almost any big bear, including the grizzly.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A brown bear attacks mainly by tearing at opponents with its claws.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a brown bear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A brown bear has a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks.</p>
