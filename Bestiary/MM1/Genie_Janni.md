## Description



Genies are humanlike beings who dwell on the elemental planes. They are famous for their strength, guile, and skill with illusion magic.

The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane.

Jann speak Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran) and one alignment language (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal).

Combat

Genies prefer to outmaneuver and outthink their foes. They are not too proud to flee if it means they'll live to fight another day. If trapped, they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for their lives and freedom.


**
*Plane Shift* 
**
**(Sp):** A genie can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the genie and up to eight other creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level 13th).

Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. If they meet a foe they cannot defeat in a standup fight, they use flight and *invisibility* to regroup and maneuver to a more advantageous position.


**
*Change Size* 
**
**(Sp):** Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an *enlarge person* or *[[reduce person]]* spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day - *invisibility* (self only), *[[speak with animals]].* Caster level 12th. Once per day a janni can *[[create food and water]]* (caster level 7th) and can use *[[ethereal jaunt]]* (caster level 12th) for 1 hour. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Elemental Endurance (Ex):** Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.


**Jann as Characters**


Janni characters possess the following racial traits.
