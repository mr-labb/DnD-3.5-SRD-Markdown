A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail.

A wyvern's body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton.

Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually don't bother with anything more elaborate than a loud hiss or a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.

COMBAT

Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack nearly anything that isn't obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, snatching the opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a wyvern must hit with its talons. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and stings.


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Skills:** Wyverns have a +3 racial bonus on Spot checks.
