## Description

<p>A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail.</p>
<p>A wyvern's body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton.</p>
<p>Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually don't bother with anything more elaborate than a loud hiss or a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack nearly anything that isn't obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, snatching the opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a wyvern must hit with its talons. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and stings.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Wyverns have a +3 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
