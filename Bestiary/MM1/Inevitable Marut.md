Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the universe.

Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a fundamental principle. When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using *geas* and *[[mark of justice]]* to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming.

Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long.

Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Their forms vary, but all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork creatures, with gears and pistons where muscles would be on flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes glow with a golden radiance.

Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score and can think, learn, and remember.

Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language of their first target.

Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.

Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary measures to cheat death in some other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse death aren't worthy of a marut's attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.

When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably toward the foe, never resting.

Combat

Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely on the transgressor they've been assigned to, ignoring other combatants completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress, but it won't tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its quarry. Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who attacks an inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force is met with deadly force in return.

An inevitable's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** An inevitable heals a certain amount of damage each round (specified in each variety's description) as long as it has at least 1 hit point. However, damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at the normal rate.

Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been trying to avoid. Those who defile death through necromancy may instead receive a *geas* and/or *[[mark of justice]]* to enforce proper respect. It typically uses *[[wall of force]]* to shut off any escape routes, then opens up with *[[chain lightning]]* while it closes to melee range. Once there, it strikes with its massive fists, using *[[circle of death]]* if beset by numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with repeated uses of *[[Dispel Magic Greater|greater dispel magic]],* and it uses *[[dimension door]]* and *[[locate creature]]* to track down foes who flee.

A marut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su):** A marut's left fist delivers a loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an extra 3d6 points of sonic damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its right fist delivers a shock for an extra 3d6 points of electricity damage, and the flash of lightning causes the target to be blinded for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the blindness). The save DCs are Strength-based and include the marut's Ability Focus feat.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[air walk]], [[dimension door]], fear* (DC 18) *, [[Command Greater|greater command]]* (DC 19) *, [[Dispel Magic Greater|greater dispel magic]], [[Inflict Light Wounds Mass|mass inflict light wounds]]* (DC 19), *[[locate creature]], [[true seeing]];* 1/day - *[[chain lightning]]* (DC 20) *, [[circle of death]]* (DC 20) *, [[mark of justice]], [[wall of force]];* 1/week - *[[earthquake]]* (DC 22) *, [[Geas_Quest|geas/quest]], [[plane shift]]* (DC 21) *.* Caster level 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Skills:** A marut has a +4 racial bonus on Concentration, Listen, and Spot checks.
