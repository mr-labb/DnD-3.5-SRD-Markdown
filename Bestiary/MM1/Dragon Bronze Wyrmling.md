Breath Weapon (Su): Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning (2d6 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 14) or a cone of repulsion gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Will save (DC 14) or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round. This is a mind-influencing compulsion enchantment. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.
