## Description



Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

While its appearance suggests it is incorporeal, a hellcats has a corporeal body and can be harmed by physical attacks.

Hellcats use a natural telepathy to communicate with one another and those they encounter. A hellcat measures about 9 feet long and weighs about 900 pounds.


**Devil Traits:** Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

A hellcat can hold its own in combat thanks to sharp claws and wicked fangs. It prefers to leap upon opponents, just as a lion does.

A hellcat's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a hellcat must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a hellcat charges, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d8+3.


**Invisible in Light (Ex):** A hellcat is invisible in any area lit well enough for a human to see. In a darkened area, it shows up as a faintly glowing outline visible up to 30 feet away (60 feet if the viewer has [[low-light vision]]). Magical darkness smothers the glow and conceals the outline.


**Skills:** Hellcats have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Move Silently checks.
