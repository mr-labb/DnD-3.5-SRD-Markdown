## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>Dire wolverines grow to about 12 feet in length and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Dire wolverines attack opponents wantonly, fearing no other creatures.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rage (Ex):</b> A dire wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a berserk rage on its next turn, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. An enraged dire wolverine gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and -2 AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A dire wolverine has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
