## Description

<p>This patient carnivore remains completely still as it waits for prey to come near.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a giant praying mantis must hit with its claws attack. If it wins the ensuing grapple check, it establishes a hold and makes a bite attack as a primary attack (at its full +6 attack bonus).</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A giant praying mantis has a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Spot checks. *Because of its camouflage, the Hide bonus increases to +12 when a mantis is surrounded by foliage.</p>
