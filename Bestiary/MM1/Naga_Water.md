## Description

<p>All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.</p>
<p>Water nagas speak Aquan and Common.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange most encounters to suit their wishes.</p>
<p>Water nagas prefer to stay mostly concealed in a body of water while they launch a spell attack.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> Water nagas cast spells as 7th-level sorcerers but never use fire spells.</p>
<p>
            <i>Typical Sorcerer Spells Known</i> (6/7/7/4; save DC 12 + spell level): 0 - <i>acid splash, daze, detect magic, light, mage hand, open/close, read magic;</i> 1st -  <i>expeditious retreat, magic missile, obscuring mist, shield, true strike;</i> 2nd - <i>invisibility, acid arrow, mirror image;</i> 3rd - <i>protection from energy, suggestion.</i></p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A water naga has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
