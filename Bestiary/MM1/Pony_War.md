Warponies are bred for strength and aggression, and are similar to light warhorses.

Combat

A warpony can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a warpony is up to 100 pounds; a medium load, 101-200 pounds; and a heavy load, 201-300 pounds. A warpony can drag 1,500 pounds.
