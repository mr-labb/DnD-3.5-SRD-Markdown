## Description

<p>Sprites are reclusive fey. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Combat</p>
<p>Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pintsized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.</p>

<p>Pixies wear bright clothing, often including a cap and shoes with curled and pointed toes.</p>
<p>A pixie stands about 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.</p>
<p>Pixies speak Sylvan and Common, and may know other languages as well.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>The normally carefree pixies ferociously attack evil creatures and unwanted intruders. They take full advantage of their invisibility and other abilities to harass and drive away opponents.</p>
<p>
            <b>Greater Invisibility (Su):</b> A pixie remains invisible even when it attacks. This ability is constant, but the pixie can suppress or resume it as a free action.</p>
<p>

<p>
            <i>Memory Loss:</i> An opponent struck by this arrow must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or lose all memory. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. The subject retains skills, languages, and class abilities but forgets everything else until he or she receives a <i>heal</i> spell or memory restoration with <i>limited wish, wish,</i> or <i>miracle</i>.</p>
<p>
            <i>Sleep:</i> Any opponent struck by this arrow, regardless of Hit Dice, must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a <i>sleep</i> spell. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pixies as Characters</b>
