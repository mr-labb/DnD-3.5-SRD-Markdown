Sprites are reclusive fey. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Combat

Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pintsized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.


**Skills:** All sprites have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

Pixies wear bright clothing, often including a cap and shoes with curled and pointed toes.

A pixie stands about 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.

Pixies speak Sylvan and Common, and may know other languages as well.

Combat

The normally carefree pixies ferociously attack evil creatures and unwanted intruders. They take full advantage of their invisibility and other abilities to harass and drive away opponents.


**[[Invisibility Greater|Greater Invisibility]] (Su):** A pixie remains invisible even when it attacks. This ability is constant, but the pixie can suppress or resume it as a free action.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day - *[[Confusion Lesser|lesser confusion]]* (DC 14), *[[dancing lights]], [[detect chaos]], [[detect good]], [[detect evil]], [[detect law]], [[detect thoughts]]* (DC 15), *[[dispel magic]], entangle* (DC 14), *[[permanent image]]* (DC 19; visual and auditory elements only), *[[Compendium/Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]* (self only). Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

One pixie in ten can use *[[irresistible dance]]* (caster level 8th) once per day.


**Special Arrows (Ex):** Pixies sometimes employ arrows that deal no damage but can erase memory or put a creature to sleep.


*Memory Loss:* An opponent struck by this arrow must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or lose all memory. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. The subject retains skills, languages, and class abilities but forgets everything else until he or she receives a *heal* spell or memory restoration with *[[limited wish]], wish,* or *[[miracle]]* .


*Sleep:* Any opponent struck by this arrow, regardless of Hit Dice, must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a *sleep* spell. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.


**Pixies as Characters**


A pixie character exchanges its 1 HD of fey for its first class level.

Pixie characters possess the following racial traits.
