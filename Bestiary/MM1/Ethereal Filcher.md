## Description

<p>Ethereal filchers are bizarre-looking creatures with a penchant for snatching trinkets from passersby. Their ability to move quickly between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane makes them spectacular pickpockets.</p>
<p>Ethereal filchers do not speak.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>An ethereal filcher prowls about, using its ethereal jaunt ability to move about unseen (and often through solid objects). Upon locating a likely mark, it shifts to the Material Plane, attempting to catch its victim unaware. The creature attempts to seize an item, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. It is not above delivering a bite to distract its target. Once it secures a trinket, it scurries back to its lair to admire its prize. When badly wounded, a filcher escapes rather than continuing the fight.</p>
<p>Any number of simple ruses can blunt a filcher's attack.</p>
<p>
            <b>Detect Magic (Su):</b> Ethereal filchers can detect magic as the spell (caster level 5th) at will.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</b> An ethereal filcher can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and shift back again as a free action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 1 round before returning to the Material Plane. The ability is otherwise identical with the <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 15th).</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Ethereal filchers have a +8 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand checks, and a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
