## Description

<p>The statistics presented here describe a male African lion, which is 5 to 8 feet long and weighs 330 to 550 pounds. Females are slightly smaller but use the same statistics.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a lion charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a lion must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +7 melee, damage 1d4+2.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Lions have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +12.</p>
