## Description



The statistics presented here describe a male African lion, which is 5 to 8 feet long and weighs 330 to 550 pounds. Females are slightly smaller but use the same statistics.

Combat


**Pounce (Ex):** If a lion charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a lion must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +7 melee, damage 1d4+2.


**Skills:** Lions have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +12.
