## Description

<p>These bottom-dwelling sea creatures are dangerous only to their prey. If disturbed, they usually try to escape.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an octopus must hit an opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and automatically deals bite damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ink Cloud (Ex):</b> An octopus can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the octopus normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.</p>
<p>
            <b>Jet (Ex):</b> An octopus can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 200 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> An octopus can change colors, giving it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. An octopus also can squeeze and contort its body, giving it a +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks. An octopus has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
