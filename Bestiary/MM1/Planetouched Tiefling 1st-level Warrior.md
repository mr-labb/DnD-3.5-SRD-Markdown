## Description

<p>Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or her bloodline back to an outsider, usually a fiend or celestial.</p>
<p>The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special qualities.</p>
<p>The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common. Aasimars are humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.</p>
<p>Many tieflings are indistinguishable from humans. Others have small horns, pointed teeth, red eyes, a whiff of brimstone about them, or even cloven feet. No two tieflings are the same.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Tieflings are sneaky, subtle, and generally conniving. They prefer to strike from ambush and usually avoid a fair fight if they can.</p>
