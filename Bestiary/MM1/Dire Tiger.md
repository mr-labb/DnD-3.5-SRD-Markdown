## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>Dire tigers prey on just about anything that moves. They will patiently stalk a potential meal, striking whenever the creature lets down its guard.</p>
<p>Dire tigers grow to be over 12 feet long and can weigh up to 6,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A dire tiger attacks by running at prey, leaping, and clawing and biting as it rakes with its rear claws.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a dire tiger must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a dire tiger charges, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+4.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Dire tigers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.</p>
