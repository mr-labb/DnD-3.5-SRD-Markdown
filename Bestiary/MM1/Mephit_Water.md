Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.

Water mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Water.

Water mephits are jaunty creatures with an unflagging sense of humor who quickly get on the nerves of everyone around them. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.

Water mephits speak Common and Aquan.

Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.


**
*Summon Mephit* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** 15-foot cone of caustic liquid, damage 1d8 acid, Reflex DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** Once per hour a water mephit can hurl an acidic blob that functions like *[[acid arrow]]* (caster level 3rd). Once per day it can create a mass of smelly fog that duplicates the effect of a *[[stinking cloud]]* spell (DC 15, caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** A water mephit heals only if it is exposed to rain or submerged up to its waist in water.


**Skills:** A water mephit has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered.

It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
