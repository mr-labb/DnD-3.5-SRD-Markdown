## Description

<p>Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they have many aspects in common. All take the form of crones whose bent shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.</p>
<p>Hags speak Giant and Common.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of the individual members.</p>
<p>An annis commonly uses its <i>disguise self</i> ability to take the form of an exceptionally tall human, a fair giant, or an ogre.</p>
<p>An annis stands some 8 feet tall and weighs about 325 pounds.</p>
<p>Though physically powerful, these hags do not favor simple assaults but try to divide and confuse their foes before combat. They love to pose as commoners or gentlefolk to lull their victims into a sense of false security before they attack.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an annis must hit a Large or smaller opponent with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d6+7. An annis can attack a grappled foe with both claws at no penalty.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rend (Ex):</b> An annis that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d6+10 points of damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>disguise self</i>, <i>fog cloud.</i> Caster level 8th.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hag Covey</b>
          </p>
<p>From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.</p>
<p>A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a <i>veil</i> spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as <i>hag eyes</i> (see below).</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>animate dead, bestow curse</i> (DC 17)<i>, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana</i> (DC 18)<i>, polymorph, veil</i> (DC 19)<i>, vision.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities (which requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must participate.</p>
<p>Once per month, a covey that does not have a <i>hag eye</i> can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).</p>
<p>Hag Eye</p>
<p>A <i>hag eye</i> is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a <i>gem of seeing</i> or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a <i>hag eye</i> is worn as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the <i>hag eye</i> can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A <i>hag eye</i> has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a <i>hag eye</i> deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.</p>
