## Description

<p>Sprites are reclusive fey. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Combat</p>
<p>Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pintsized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> All sprites have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.</p>
<p>Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. Females often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Males wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes.</p>
<p>A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Nixies speak Aquan and Sylvan. Some also speak Common.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Nixies rely on their <i>charm person</i> ability to deter enemies, entering combat only to protect themselves and their territory.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Charm Person</i> (Sp):</b> A nixie can use <i>charm person</i> three times per day as the spell (caster level 4th). Those affected must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be <i>charmed</i> for 24 hours. Most <i>charmed</i> creatures are used to perform heavy labor, guard duty, and other onerous tasks for the nixie community. Shortly before the effect wears off, the nixie escorts the <i>charmed</i> creature away and orders it to keep walking. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Amphibious (Ex):</b> Although nixies are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Water Breathing</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a nixie can use <i>water breathing</i> as the spell (caster level 12th). Nixies usually bestow this effect on those they have <i>charmed.</i></p>
<p>
            <b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> This ability works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a nixie has a +6 racial bonus on the check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A nixie has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *Nixies have a +5 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the water.</p>
