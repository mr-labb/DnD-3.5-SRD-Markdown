## Description

<p>Black dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon’s scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.</p>
<p>Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
						<b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of acid.</p>
<p>
						<b>Water Breathing (Ex): </b>A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</p>
