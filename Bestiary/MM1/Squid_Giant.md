## Description

<p>These voracious creatures can have bodies more than 20 feet long and attack almost anything they meet.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>An opponent can attack a giant squid's tentacles with a sunder attempt as if they were weapons. A giant squid's tentacles have 10 hit points each. If a giant squid is currently grappling a target with the tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder attempt. Severing one of a giant squid's tentacles deals 5 points of damage to the creature. A giant squid usually withdraws from combat if it loses five tentacles. The creature regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A giant squid deals 1d6+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a giant squid must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. *A giant squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ink Cloud (Ex):</b> A giant squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 20 feet high by 20 feet wide by 20 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.</p>
<p>
            <b>Jet (Ex):</b> A giant squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 320 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A giant squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
