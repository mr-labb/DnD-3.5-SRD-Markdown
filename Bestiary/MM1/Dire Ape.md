## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>A dire ape stands about 9 feet tall and weighs from 800 to 1,200 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Dire apes attack anything that enters their territory, even other dire apes. If an opponent's armor foils a dire ape's attacks, the creature will attempt to grapple and pin, then rend the prone opponent.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rend (Ex):</b> A dire ape that hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d6+12 points of damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Dire apes have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
