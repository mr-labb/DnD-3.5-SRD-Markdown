## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A copper dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of acid (24d4 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 37) or a cone of slow gas. Creatures within the must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 37) or be slowed for 1d6 rounds plus 12 rounds. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 360 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (38).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 35) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
