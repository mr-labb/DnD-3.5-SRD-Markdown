Though not carnivores, these wild swine are bad-tempered and usually charge anyone who disturbs them. A boar is covered in coarse, grayish-black fur. Adult males are about 4 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder.

Combat


**Ferocity (Ex):** A boar is such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.
