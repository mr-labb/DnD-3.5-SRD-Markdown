## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A white dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of cold (3d6 cold damage, Reflex save for half damage DC 16). Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.
