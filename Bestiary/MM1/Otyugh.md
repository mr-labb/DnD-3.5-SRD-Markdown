## Description



A typical otyugh has a body 8 feet in diameter and weighs about 500 pounds.

Otyughs speak Common.

COMBAT

An otyugh attacks living creatures if it feels threatened or if it is hungry; otherwise it is content to remain hidden. Otyughs slash and squeeze opponents with their tentacles, which they also use to drag prey into their mouths.


**Constrict (Ex):** An otyugh deals automatic tentacle damage with a successful grapple check.


**Disease (Ex):** Filth fever - bite, Fortitude DC 14, incubation period 1d3 days; damage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, an otyugh must hit with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Skills:** *An otyugh has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when in its lair, due to its natural coloration.
