## Description

<p>A typical otyugh has a body 8 feet in diameter and weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>Otyughs speak Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>An otyugh attacks living creatures if it feels threatened or if it is hungry; otherwise it is content to remain hidden. Otyughs slash and squeeze opponents with their tentacles, which they also use to drag prey into their mouths.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> An otyugh deals automatic tentacle damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Disease (Ex):</b> Filth fever - bite, Fortitude DC 14, incubation period 1d3 days; damage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an otyugh must hit with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> *An otyugh has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when in its lair, due to its natural coloration.</p>
