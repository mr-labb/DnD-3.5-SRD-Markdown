## Description



Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.

Salt mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

Salt mephits are sarcastic creatures who loathe water and moisture of any kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds.

Salt mephits speak Common and Terran.

Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Breath Weapon (Su):** A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.


**
*Summon Mephit* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** 10-foot cone of salt crystals, damage 1d4, Reflex DC 13 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by itching skin and burning eyes. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** Once per hour a salt mephit can use *glitterdust* (DC 14, caster level 3rd).

Once per day it can draw the moisture from an area in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Living creatures within range take 2d8 points of damage (Fortitude DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This effect is especially devastating to plant creatures and aquatic creatures, which take a -2 penalty on their saving throws. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** A salt mephit heals only if in an arid environment.
