## Description

<p>Six of the beast's tentacles are shorter arms about 30 feet long; the remaining two are nearly 60 feet long and covered with barbs. Its beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of its body.</p>
<p>Krakens speak Common and Aquan.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then grab and crush with their arms or drag victims into their huge jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken's tentacles or arms as if they were weapons<i>.</i> A kraken's tentacles have 20 hit points, and its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is currently grappling a target with one tentacle or arm, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the sunder attempt. Severing a kraken's tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal to half the limb's full normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws from combat if it loses both tentacles or three of its arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the kraken must hit with an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Jet (Ex):</b> A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ink Cloud (Ex):</b> A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day - <i>control weather, control winds, dominate animal</i> (DC 18), <i>resist energy.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
