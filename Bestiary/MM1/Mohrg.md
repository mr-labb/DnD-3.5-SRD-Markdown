Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died without atoning for their crimes. Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

COMBAT

Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They often catch opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than zombies.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.


**Paralyzing Touch (Su):** A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based. **Create Spawn (Su):** Creatures killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the morhg's control. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
