## Description

<p>Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest animals known. Relatively small whales (such as the orca presented here) can be vicious predators, attacking virtually anything they detect.</p>
<p>Also known as sperm whales, these creatures can be up to 60 feet long. They prey on giant squids.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Whales can "see" by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this and forces the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human's.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hold Breath (Ex):</b> A whale can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A whale has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.</p>
