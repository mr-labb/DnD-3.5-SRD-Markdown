## Description

<p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
<p>Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.</p>
<p>A pit fiend often wraps its wings around itself like a grotesque cloak, and appears wreathed in flames.</p>
<p>A pit fiend is 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Devil Traits:</b> Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Pit fiends are wily and resourceful fighters, using <i>invisibility</i> to gain the upper hand and biting at foes seemingly able to see them. They don't hesitate to blanket an area with <i>fireballs</i>, and can call down the wrath of an inferno with <i>meteor swarm.</i></p>
<p>A pit fiend's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A pit fiend deals 2d8+26 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Disease (Su):</b> A creature struck by a pit fiend's bite attack must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> A pit fiend can radiate a 20-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell (caster level 18th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same pit fiend's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a pit fiend must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 27, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage death. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>blasphemy</i> (DC 25), <i>create undead, fireball</i> (DC 21), <i>greater dispel magic, greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>invisibility, magic circle against good, mass hold monster</i> (DC 27), <i>persistent image</i> (DC 23), <i>power word stun, unholy aura</i> (DC 26); 1/day - <i>meteor swarm</i> (DC 27). Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>Once per year a pit fiend can use <i>wish</i> as the spell (caster level 20th).</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Devil</i> (Sp):</b> Twice per day a pit fiend can automatically summon 2 lemures, bone devils, or bearded devils, or 1 erinyes, horned devil, or ice devil. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> A pit fiend takes normal damage from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.</p>
<p>Tactics Round-by-Round</p>
<p>A pit fiend typically opens combat by using its spell-like abilities, attempting to neutralize dangerous opponents before entering melee.</p>
<p>
            <i>Prior to combat: Unholy aura</i>; activate fear aura, <i>summon devil</i>.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 1:</i> Quickened <i>fireball</i> and <i>mass hold monster</i> if facing three or more visible, active opponents; otherwise <i>power word stun</i> against unarmored opponent (preferably a spellcaster).</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 2: Meteor swarm</i> against as many foes as possible, approach worst-injured enemy.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 3:</i> Full attack against injured enemy.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 4:</i> Continue melee against injured enemy, or <i>power word stun</i> against annoying spellcaster.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 5:</i> Repeat from round 1, or <i>greater teleport</i> to safety if endangered.</p>
