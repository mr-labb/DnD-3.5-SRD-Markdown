## Description

<p>Sprites are reclusive fey. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Combat</p>
<p>Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pintsized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> All sprites have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.</p>
<p>Grigs can leap great distances. They have light blue skin, forest-green hair, and brown hairy legs, and usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. A grig stands 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound.</p>
<p>Grigs speak Sylvan. Some also speak Common.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Grigs are fierce by sprite standards, attacking opponents fearlessly with bow and dagger.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>disguise self, entangle</i> (DC 13)<i>, invisibility</i> (self only), <i>pyrotechnics</i> (DC 14)<i>, ventriloquism</i> (DC 13)<i>.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fiddle (Su):</b> One grig in each band carries a tiny, grig-sized fiddle.

The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Grigs have a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks. *They also have a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks in a forest setting.</p>
