Sprites are reclusive fey. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Combat

Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pintsized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.


**Skills:** All sprites have a +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

Grigs can leap great distances. They have light blue skin, forest-green hair, and brown hairy legs, and usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. A grig stands 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound.

Grigs speak Sylvan. Some also speak Common.

Combat

Grigs are fierce by sprite standards, attacking opponents fearlessly with bow and dagger.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day - *[[disguise self]], entangle* (DC 13) *, invisibility* (self only), *[[pyrotechnics]]* (DC 14) *, [[ventriloquism]]* (DC 13) *.* Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Fiddle (Su):** One grig in each band carries a tiny, grig-sized fiddle. When the fiddler plays, any nonsprite within 30 feet of the instrument must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or be affected as though by *[[irresistible dance]]* for as long as the playing continues. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Skills:** Grigs have a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks. *They also have a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks in a forest setting.
