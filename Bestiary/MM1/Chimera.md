## Description

<p>A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera's dragon head might be black, blue, green, red, or white.</p>
<p>Chimeras can speak Draconic but seldom bother to do so, except when toadying to more powerful creatures.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>The chimera prefers to surprise prey. It often swoops down from the sky or lies concealed until it charges. The dragon head can loose a breath weapon instead of biting. Several chimeras attack in concert.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A chimera's breath weapon depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a chimera's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 17 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>To determine a chimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A chimera's three heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks.</p>
<p>*In areas of scrubland or brush, a chimera gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a chimera is up to 348 pounds; a medium load, 349-699 pounds, and a heavy load, 700-1,050 pounds.</p>
