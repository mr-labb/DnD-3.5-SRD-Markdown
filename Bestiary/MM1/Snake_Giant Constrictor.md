## Description

<p>Giant constrictor snakes are more aggressive than their smaller cousins, principally because they need a great amount of food to survive.</p>
<p>Constrictor snakes hunt by grabbing prey with their mouths and then squeezing it with their powerful bodies.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> On a successful grapple check, a constrictor snake deals 1d8+10 points of damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a constrictor snake must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A snake can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. Snakes use either their Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher. A snake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
