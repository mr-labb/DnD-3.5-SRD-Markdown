## Description

<p>Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.</p>
<p>A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.</p>
<p>Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.</p>
<p>These sphinxes are the female counterparts of androsphinxes.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx's description provides its attack bonus and damage.</p>
<p>In close combat, gynosphinxes use their powerful claws to flay the flesh from their enemies. Despite their deadly nature, they prefer to avoid combat whenever possible.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +11 melee, damage 1d6+2.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect magic, read magic, see invisibility</i>; 1/day - <i>comprehend languages, locate object, dispel magic,  remove curse</i> (DC 18), <i>legend lore</i>. Caster level 14th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>Once per week a gynosphinx can create a <i>symbol of death,</i> a <i>symbol of fear,</i> a <i>symbol of insanity,</i> a <i>symbol of pain,</i> a <i>symbol of persuasion,</i> a  <i>symbol of sleep,</i> and a <i>symbol of stunning</i> as the spells (caster level 18th), except that all save DCs are 22 and each symbol remains a maximum of one week once scribed. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
