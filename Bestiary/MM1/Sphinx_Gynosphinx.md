Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.

A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.

Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.

These sphinxes are the female counterparts of androsphinxes.

Combat

Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx's description provides its attack bonus and damage.

In close combat, gynosphinxes use their powerful claws to flay the flesh from their enemies. Despite their deadly nature, they prefer to avoid combat whenever possible.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +11 melee, damage 1d6+2.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day - *[[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance|clairaudience/clairvoyance]], [[detect magic]], [[read magic]], [[see invisibility]]* ; 1/day - *[[comprehend languages]], [[locate object]], [[dispel magic]], [[remove curse]]* (DC 18), *[[legend lore]]* . Caster level 14th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Once per week a gynosphinx can create a *[[symbol of death]],* a *[[symbol of fear]],* a *[[symbol of insanity]],* a *[[symbol of pain]],* a *[[symbol of persuasion]],* a *[[symbol of sleep]],* and a *[[symbol of stunning]]* as the spells (caster level 18th), except that all save DCs are 22 and each symbol remains a maximum of one week once scribed. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
