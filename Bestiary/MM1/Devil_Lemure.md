## Description



Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

A lemure is about 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds.

Lemures are mindless and cannot communicate, but they are sensitive to telepathic messages from other devils, typically obeying a devil's mental commands.


**Devil Traits:** Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

Lemures surge toward anything they meet and try to claw it apart. Only a telepathic command from other devils or the complete destruction of the lemures can make them stop.

A lemure's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Mindless (Ex):** Immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
