A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.

A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.

Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.

COMBAT

In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.


**[[Detect Thoughts]] (Su):** A rakshasa can continuously use [[detect thoughts]] as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Spells:** A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.


*Typical Sorcerer Spells Known* (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 - *detect magic, light, [[mage hand]], message, [[read magic]], resistance, [[touch of fatigue]];* 1st - *[[charm person]], [[mage armor]], [[magic missile]], shield, silent image;* 2nd - *[[Bears Endurance|bear's endurance]], invisibility, [[acid arrow]];* 3rd - *haste, suggestion.*


**Change Shape (Su):** A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A *[[true seeing]]* spell reveals its natural form.


**Skills:** A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. *When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent's mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a further +4.
