## Description

<p>A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.</p>
<p>A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.</p>
<p>Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.</p>
<p>
            <b>Detect Thoughts (Su):</b> A rakshasa can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p>
            <i>Typical Sorcerer Spells Known</i> (6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 - <i>detect magic, light, mage hand, message, read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue;</i> 1st -  <i>charm person, mage armor, magic missile, shield, silent image;</i> 2nd - <i>bear's endurance, invisibility, acid arrow;</i> 3rd - <i>haste, suggestion.</i></p>
<p>
            <b>Change Shape (Su):</b> A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals its natural form.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. *When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent's mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a further +4.</p>
