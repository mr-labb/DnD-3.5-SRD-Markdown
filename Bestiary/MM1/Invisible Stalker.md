## Description

<p>Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform specific tasks.</p>
<p>A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.</p>
<p>Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A <i>see invisibility</i> spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud, while a <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals a roiling cloud of vapor.</p>
<p>These creatures speak only Auran but can understand Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>An invisible stalker attacks by using the air itself as a weapon. It creates a sudden, intense blast of wind that pounds a single target on the same plane as the creature.</p>
<p>An invisible stalker can be killed only when it is on the Elemental Plane of Air. When performing a task elsewhere, it automatically returns to its home plane when it takes damage sufficient to destroy it.</p>
<p>
            <b>Natural Invisibility (Su):</b> This ability is constant, allowing a stalker to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Tracking (Ex):</b> An invisible stalker is a consummate tracker and makes Spot checks instead of the usual Survival checks to trace a creature's passage.</p>
<p>
          </p>
