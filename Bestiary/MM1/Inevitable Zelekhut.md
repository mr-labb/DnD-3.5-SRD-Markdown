## Description



Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the universe.

Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a fundamental principle. When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using *geas* and *[[mark of justice]]* to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming.

Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long.

Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Their forms vary, but all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork creatures, with gears and pistons where muscles would be on flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes glow with a golden radiance.

Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score and can think, learn, and remember.

Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language of their first target.

Zelekhuts are charged with hunting down those who would deny justice - especially those who flee to escape punishment. Expert trackers, they use a combination of natural skill and magic to find fugitives wherever they may hide.

A zelekhut may initially appear rather non-threatening - but when it is about to enter combat, it can cause two spiked chains to spring forth from its forearms as a free action. In similar fashion, it can cause a pair of golden metallic wings to emerge from its back. Retracting the chains or the wings is also a free action.

Combat

Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely on the transgressor they've been assigned to, ignoring other combatants completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress, but it won't tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its quarry. Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who attacks an inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force is met with deadly force in return.

An inevitable's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Fast Healing (Ex):** An inevitable heals a certain amount of damage each round (specified in each variety's description) as long as it has at least 1 hit point. However, damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at the normal rate.

Once it has found its fugitive, a zelekhut uses its speed and its spell-like abilities to cover the most likely escape routes. Then it immobilizes any defenders while attempting to protect any innocent bystanders. Finally, it apprehends the fugitive with its spiked chains, tripping or disarming the foe as needed.

A zelekhut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance|clairaudience/clairvoyance]], [[dimensional anchor]], [[dispel magic]], fear* (DC 16) *, [[hold person]]* (DC 15) *, [[locate creature]], [[true seeing]];* 3/day - *[[hold monster]]* (DC 17) *, [[mark of justice]]* ; 1/week - *[[Geas Lesser|lesser geas]]* (DC 16) *.* Caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Skills:** A zelekhut has a +4 racial bonus on Search and Sense Motive checks.


**Feats:** Due to its centaur-like construction, a zelekhut qualifies for feats as if it had the Mounted Combat feat.
