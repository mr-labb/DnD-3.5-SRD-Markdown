<p>COMBAT</p>

            <b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> A pseudodragon can locate creatures within 60 feet by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues). Opponents the pseudodragon can't actually see still have total concealment against the pseudodragon.</p>
<p>
            <b>Telepathy (Su):</b> Pseudodragons can communicate telepathically with creatures that speak Common or Sylvan, provided they are within 60 feet.</p>
