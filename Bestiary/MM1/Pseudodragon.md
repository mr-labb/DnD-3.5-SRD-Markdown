## Description



A pseudodragon has a body about 1 foot long, with a 2-foot tail. It weights about 7 pounds.

A pseudodragon can communicate telepathically and can also vocalize animal noises.

COMBAT

A pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite, but its principal weapon is its sting-equipped tail.


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage sleep for 1 minute, secondary damage sleep for 1d3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.


**Blindsense (Ex):** A pseudodragon can locate creatures within 60 feet by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and [[Scent]], but also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues). Opponents the pseudodragon can't actually see still have total concealment against the pseudodragon.


**Telepathy (Su):** Pseudodragons can communicate telepathically with creatures that speak Common or Sylvan, provided they are within 60 feet.


**Skills:** Pseudodragons have a chameleonlike ability that grants them a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *In forests or overgrown areas, this bonus improves to +8.
