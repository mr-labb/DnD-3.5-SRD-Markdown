## Mephit

Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes. 

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance. 

#### Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature. 

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. 

#### Breath Weapon (Su)
A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details. 

#### Spell-Like Abilities
All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.

### *Summon Mephit* (Sp)
Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. 

#### Fast Healing (Ex)
Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.
