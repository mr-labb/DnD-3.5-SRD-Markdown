## Description



Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.

A typical phase spider's body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700 pounds.

Phase spiders cannot speak.

COMBAT

Phase spiders dwell and hunt on the Material Plane. Once a spider locates prey, however, it shifts to the Ethereal Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The spider shifts in, bites its victim, and retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane.


**[[Ethereal Jaunt]] (Su):** A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or during a move action). The ability is otherwise identical with *[[ethereal jaunt]]* (caster level 15th).


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Skills:** A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.
