## Description

<p>Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>A typical phase spider's body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700 pounds.</p>
<p>Phase spiders cannot speak.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Phase spiders dwell and hunt on the Material Plane. Once a spider locates prey, however, it shifts to the Ethereal Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The spider shifts in, bites its victim, and retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</b> A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or during a move action). The ability is otherwise identical with <i>ethereal jaunt</i> (caster level 15th).</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d8 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
