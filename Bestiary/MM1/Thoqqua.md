## Description



A thoqqua is about 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It weighs about 200 pounds.

COMBAT

When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct is to attack. Its favored tactic is to spring directly at a foe, either by bursting out of the rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself like a spring. (Treat this as a charge, even though the thoqqua does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)


**Heat (Ex):** Merely touching or being touched by a thoqqua automatically deals 2d6 fire damage.


**Burn (Ex):** When a thoqqua hits with its slam attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or catch fire. The save DC is Constitution-based. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds if not extinguished sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round action to put out the flame.
