## Description

<p>A satyr's hair is red or chestnut brown, while its hooves and horns are jet black. A satyr is about as tall and heavy as a half-elf.</p>
<p>Satyrs speak Sylvan, and most also speak Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>The keen senses of a satyr make it almost impossible to surprise one in the wild. Conversely, with their own natural grace and agility, satyrs can sneak up on travelers who are not carefully watching the surrounding wilderness. Once engaged in battle, an unarmed satyr attacks with a powerful head butt. A satyr expecting trouble is likely to be armed with a bow and a dagger and typically looses arrows from hiding, weakening an enemy before closing.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pipes (Su):</b> Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their pan pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by <i>charm person, sleep,</i> or <i>fear</i> (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).</p>
<p>In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe's effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.</p>
