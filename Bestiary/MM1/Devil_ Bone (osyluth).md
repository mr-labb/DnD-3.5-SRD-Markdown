## Description

<p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
<p>Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.</p>
<p>Bone devils stand about 9 feet tall and weigh about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Devil Traits:</b> Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Bone devils hate all other creatures and attack ruthlessly. They freely use <i>wall of ice</i> to keep the enemy divided.</p>
<p>A bone devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> Bone devils can radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell (caster level 7th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bone devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>dimensional anchor, fly, invisibility</i> (self only), <i>major image</i> (DC 15), <i>wall of ice</i>. Caster level 12th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Devil</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a bone devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of success, or another bone devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
