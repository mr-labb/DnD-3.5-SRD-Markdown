A typical lamia is about 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.

COMBAT

Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no stomach for a fair fight. It uses its illusion abilities to lure heroes into perilous situations, and then uses its Spring Attack feat to bound out of the shadows and drain Wisdom from its opponents. When it has sapped the will of its victim, it uses its enchantment abilities to beguile and ensnare the unfortunate soul. A lamia forced into physical combat attacks with a dagger in one of its human hands and a pair of lion-like claws.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[disguise self]], [[ventriloquism]]* ; 3/day - *[[charm monster]]* (DC 15), *[[major image]]* (DC 14), *[[mirror image]], suggestion* (DC 14); 1/day - *[[deep slumber]]* (DC 14). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Wisdom Drain (Su):** A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its melee touch attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to use this power early in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to *[[charm monster]]* and *suggestion.*


**Skills:** Lamias have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Hide checks.
