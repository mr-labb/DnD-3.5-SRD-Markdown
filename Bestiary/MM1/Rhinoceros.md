## Description



The rhinoceros is infamous for its bad temper and willingness to charge intruders.

The statistics presented here are based on the African black rhino, which is 6 to 14 feet long, 3 to 6 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs up to 6,000 pounds. These statistics can describe any herbivore of similar size and similar natural weapons (antlers, horns, tusks, or the like).

Combat

When it is harassed or annoyed, a rhinoceros lowers its head and charges.


**Powerful Charge (Ex):** A rhinoceros deals 4d6+24 points of damage when it makes a charge.
