## Description

<p>Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and functional garb. The skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves average 4 feet tall and weigh as much as adult humans.</p>
<p>Dwarves speak Dwarven. Most who travel outside dwarven lands (as traders, mercenaries, or adventurers) know the Common tongue, while warriors in the dwarven cities usually learn Goblin to better interrogate and spy on those evil denizens of the deep caves.</p>
<p>Most dwarves encountered outside their home are warriors.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Dwarves are experts in combat, effectively using their environment and executing well-planned group attacks. They rarely use magic in fights, since they have few wizards or sorcerers (but dwarven clerics throw themselves into battle as heartily as their fellow warriors). If they have time to prepare, they may build deadfalls or other traps involving stone. In addition to the dwarven waraxe and thrown hammer, dwarves also use warhammers, picks, shortbows, heavy crossbows, and maces.</p>
<p>
            <b>Dwarf Traits (Ex):</b> Dwarves possess the following racial traits.</p>
<p>The dwarf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
<p>SUBRACES</p>
<p>The information above is for hill dwarves, the most common variety.</p>
<p>There are three other major dwarven subraces, which differ from hill dwarves as follows.</p>
<p>
            <b>Deep Dwarf</b>
          </p>
<p>These dwarves live far underground and tend to be more standoffish with non-dwarves.</p>
<p>Deep dwarves are the same height as other dwarves, but leaner. Their skin sometimes has a reddish tinge, and their large eyes lack the brightness of those of their kindred, being a washed-out blue. Their hair color ranges from bright red to straw blond. They have little contact with surface dwellers, relying on hill dwarves or mountain dwarves to trade goods for them.</p>
<p>Deep dwarves speak Dwarven and Goblin, and occasionally Draconic or Undercommon.</p>
<p>
            <b>Deep Dwarf Traits (Ex):</b> These traits are in addition to the hill dwarf traits, except where noted.</p>
<p>
            <b>Duergar</b>
          </p>
<p>See the entry on Duergar.</p>
<p>
            <b>Mountain Dwarf</b>
          </p>
<p>Mountain dwarves live deeper under the mountains than hill dwarves but generally not as far underground as deep dwarves. They average about 4-1/2 feet tall and have lighter skin and hair than hill dwarves, but the same general appearance.</p>
<p>
          </p>
