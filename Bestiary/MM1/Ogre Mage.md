## Description

<p>The ogre mage is a more intelligent and dangerous variety of its mundane cousin.</p>
<p>An ogre mage stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 700 pounds. Its skin varies in color from light green to light blue, and its hair is black or very dark brown. Ogre mages favor loose, comfortable clothing and lightweight armor.</p>
<p>Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Ogre mages rely on their spell-like abilities, resorting to physical combat only when necessary. When faced with obviously superior forces, they prefer to retreat using <i>gaseous form</i> rather than fight a losing battle.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>darkness, invisibility;</i> 1/day -  <i>charm person</i> (DC 14)<i>, cone of cold</i> (DC 18)<i>, gaseous form, polymorph, sleep</i> (DC 14)<i>.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Flight (Su):</b> An ogre mage can cease or resume flight as a free action. While using <i>gaseous form</i> it can fly at its normal speed and has perfect maneuverability.</p>
<p>
            <b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Fire and acid deal normal damage to an ogre mage.</p>
<p>An ogre mage that loses a limb or body part can reattach it by holding the severed member to the stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute. If the head or some other vital organ is severed, it must be reattached within 10 minutes or the creature dies. An ogre mage cannot regrow lost body parts.</p>
