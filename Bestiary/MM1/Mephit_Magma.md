## Description



Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.

Magma mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. Magma mephits are slow-witted and brutish. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.

Magma mephits speak Common and Ignan.

Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Breath Weapon (Su):** A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.


**
*Summon Mephit* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** 10-foot cone of magma, damage 1d4 fire, Reflex DC 12 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by burned skin and seared eyes unless they have [[fire Immunity|Immunity to fire]] or are otherwise protected. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is onstitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** Once per hour, a magma mephit can use *[[shapechange]]* to take the form of a pool of lava 3 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep. The mephit's [[Damage Reduction]] improves to 20/magic when in this form. The mephit can't attack while in lava form but can use other spell-like abilities. It can move at a speed of 10 feet, but it can't run. In this form the mephit can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks. The pool's touch ignites flammable materials such as paper, straw, or dry wood.

Once per day a magma mephit can use *[[pyrotechnics]]* (DC 14). It can use itself as the fire source without harm. Caster level 6th. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** A magma mephit heals only if it is touching magma, lava, or a flame at least as large as a torch.
