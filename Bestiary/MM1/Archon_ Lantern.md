## Description

<p>Archons are celestials from a lawful good-aligned plane.</p>
<p>Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.</p>
<p>Lantern archons appear as floating balls of light that glow about as brightly as a torch. Only their destruction can extinguish the glow, though they can try to hide it.</p>
<p>
            <b>Combat</b>
          </p>
<p>Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).</p>
<p>
            <b>Archon Traits:</b> An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>A lantern archon has little reason to get within melee range. It usually hovers just close enough to bring the enemy within its aura of menace, then blasts away with its light rays. Lantern archons prefer to concentrate on a single opponent, seeking to reduce enemy numbers quickly.</p>
<p>
            <b>Aura of Menace (Su):</b> Will DC 12 negates.</p>
<p>
            <b>Light Ray (Ex):</b> A lantern archon's light rays have a range of 30 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>aid, detect evil, continual flame.</i> Caster level 3rd.</p>
