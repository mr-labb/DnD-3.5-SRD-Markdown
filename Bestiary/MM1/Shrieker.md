## Description



COMBAT

Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey. When the shriekers' hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the [[violet fungus]] tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt.


**SHRIEKER**


A shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean places, often in the company of violet fungi, whose poison they are immune to.

Shriekers come in of shades of purple.

Combat

A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures prey to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise.


**Shriek (Ex):** Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers come to learn that the fungus's noise means there is food nearby.
