Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They have brown or black eyes. Halfling men often have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen. Halflings prefer simple, comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike members of most races, they prefer actual comfort to shows of wealth. Halflings reach adulthood in their early twenties and generally live into the middle of their second century. Halflings speak Halfling and Common.

Most halflings encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.

COMBAT

Halflings prefer to fight defensively, usually hiding and launching ranged attacks as the foe approaches. Their tactics are very much like those of elves but place more emphasis on cover and concealment and less on mobility.


**Halfling Traits (Ex):** Halflings possess the following racial traits.

The halfling warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

SUBRACES

The information above is for the lightfoot halfling, the most common halfling variety. There are two other major halfling subraces, which differ from lightfoot halflings as follows.


**Tallfellow**


Tallfellows are somewhat rare among halfling folk. Tallfellows are 4 feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They generally speak Elven in addition to Common and Halfling.


**Tallfellow Traits (Ex):** These traits are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.


**Deep Halfling**


These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common lightfeet.

Deep halflings are about 2-1/2 tall and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. Deep halflings speak Dwarven fluently.


**Deep Halfling Traits (Ex):** These traits are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.
