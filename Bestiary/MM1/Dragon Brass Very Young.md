## Description






A pair of mated dragons beyond the mature adult stage usually splits up, independence and the lust for treasure driving them apart. Older females continue to mate and lay eggs, but only one parent stays in the lair to raise young. Often an older female lays many clutches of eggs, keeping one to tend herself and one for her mate, and leaving the rest untended. Sometimes a female dragon places an egg or wyrmling with non-draconic foster parents.
Dragon Overland Movement

Dragons are exceedingly strong flyers and can cover vast distances quickly. Dragons do not tire as quickly as other creatures when moving overland. If a dragon attempts a hustle or forced march (see Overland Movement), check for subdual damage once every 2 hours instead of every hour.

Breath Weapon (Su): A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire (2d6 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 14) or a cone of sleep. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Will save (DC 14) or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds plus 2 rounds. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Fire Subtype (Ex): Fire immunity, double damage from cold except on a successful save.
