## Description

<p>Lycanthropes are humanoids or giants who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.</p>
<p>Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease. Sometimes a lycanthrope begins life as a normal humanoid or giant who subsequently contracts lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope. Such a creature is called an afflicted lycanthrope. Other lycanthropes are born as lycanthropes, and are known as natural lycanthropes.</p>
<p>Weretigers in humanoid form tend to be sleekly muscular, taller than average, and very agile.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A lycanthrope in its humanoid (or giant) form uses whatever tactics and weapons are favored by others of its kind, though it tends to be slightly more aggressive. A lycanthrope possesses the senses of its animal form, including scent and low-light vision, and it has a deep empathy for (and ability to communicate with) animals of its animal form. An afflicted lycanthrope damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by rage, causing it to change to its animal form involuntarily.</p>
<p>A lycanthrope in animal form fights like the animal it resembles, although its bite carries the disease of lycanthropy. It is preternaturally cunning and strong, and possesses damage reduction that is overcome only by silvered weapons.</p>
<p>Finally, a natural lycanthrope (or an afflicted lycanthrope that has become aware of its affliction) can assume a hybrid form that is a mix of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid has hands and can use weapons, but it can also attack with its teeth and claws. A hybrid can spread lycanthropy with its bite, and it has the same damage reduction that its animal form possesses.</p>
<p>Weretigers can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In tiger form, they can pounce and grab just as normal tigers do. In hybrid form, they rely on their deadly claws.</p>
<p>
            <b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A weretiger can assume a bipedal hybrid form or the form of a tiger.</p>
<p>
            <b>Curse of Lycanthropy (Su):</b> Any humanoid or giant hit by a weretiger's bite attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a weretiger in tiger form must hit with a claw or bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a weretiger in tiger form charges an opponent, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d8+3.</p>
<p>
            <b>Tiger Empathy (Ex):</b> Communicate with tigers and dire tigers, and +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against tigers and dire tigers.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> In any form, weretigers have a +4 bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8 in the tiger form.</p>
<p>The weretiger presented here is a 1st-level human warrior and natural lycanthrope, using the following base ability scores: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
<p>
            <b>LYCANTHROPY AS AN AFFLICTION</b>
          </p>
<p>When a character contracts lycanthropy through a lycanthrope's bite (see above), no symptoms appear until the first night of the next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity, temporarily becoming an NPC. The character remains in animal form, assuming the appropriate alignment, until the next dawn.</p>
<p>The character's actions during this first episode are dictated by the alignment of its animal form. The character remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom check, in which case he becomes aware of his lycanthropic condition.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a Control Shape check (see below) to resist changing into animal form. Any player character not yet aware of his or her lycanthropic condition temporarily becomes an NPC during an involuntary change, and acts according to the alignment of his or her animal form.</p>
<p>A character with awareness of his condition retains his identity and does not lose control of his actions if he changes. However, each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will save (DC 15 + number of times he has been in animal form) or permanently assume the alignment of his animal form in all shapes.</p>
<p>Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate Control Shape check DC. An attempt is a standard action and can be made each round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes the character's alignment to that of the appropriate lycanthrope.</p>
<p>Changing Form</p>
<p>Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the character performs the change on his next turn following the triggering event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character's armor and clothing (including any items worn) if the new form is larger than the character's natural form; carried items are simply dropped. Characters can hastily doff clothing while changing, but not armor. Magic armor survives the change if it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. An afflicted character who is not aware of his condition remains in animal form until the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware of his or her condition (see above) can try to resume humanoid form following a change (voluntary or involuntary) with a Control Shape check, but if he fails his check, he remains in animal (or hybrid) form until the following dawn.</p>
<p>Curing Lycanthropy</p>
<p>An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope's attack can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers the herb, use the character's save bonus or the healer's Heal modifier, whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).</p>
<p>However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage. One minute later, the character must succeed on a second DC 13 save or take an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage.</p>
<p>A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher also cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within three days of the lycanthrope's attack.</p>
<p>The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i> on the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a DC 20 Will save to break the curse (the caster knows if the spell works). If the save fails, the process must be repeated.</p>
<p>Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.</p>
<p>Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.</p>
<p>
            <b>LYCANTHROPES AS CHARACTERS</b>
          </p>
<p>Becoming a lycanthrope does not change a character's favored class but usually changes alignment (see above). This alignment change may cause characters of certain classes to lose some of their class features.</p>
<p>Lycanthrope characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
<p>
            <b>CONTROL SHAPE (WIS)</b>
          </p>
<p>Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his condition can learn Control Shape as a class skill. (An afflicted lycanthrope not yet aware of his condition can attempt Control Shape checks untrained.) This skill determines whether an afflicted lycanthrope can control his shape. A natural lycanthrope does not need this skill, since it has full control over its shape.</p>
<p>
            <b>Check (Involuntary Change):</b> An afflicted character must make a check at moonrise each night of the full moon to resist involuntarily assuming animal form. An injured character must also check for an involuntary change after accumulating enough damage to reduce his hit points by one-quarter and again after each additional one-quarter lost.</p>
<p><b>Retry (Voluntary Change):</b> A character can retry voluntary changes to animal form or hybrid form as often as he likes. Each attempt is a standard action. However, on a failed check to return to humanoid form, the character must remain in animal or hybrid form until the next dawn, when he automatically returns to humanoid form.</p>
<p><b>Special:</b> An afflicted lycanthrope cannot attempt a voluntary change until it becomes aware of its condition (see Lycanthropy as an Affliction).</p>
