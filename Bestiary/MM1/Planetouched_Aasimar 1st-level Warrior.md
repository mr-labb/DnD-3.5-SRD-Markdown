## Description

<p>Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or her bloodline back to an outsider, usually a fiend or celestial.</p>
<p>The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special qualities.</p>
<p>The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common. Aasimars are humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.</p>
<p>Aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.</p>
<p>Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes and attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take on the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is rare. Combat</p>
<p>Aasimars usually like a fair, straightforward contest. Against a particularly evil foe, however, they fight with utter conviction and to the death.</p>
<p>

              <i>Daylight</i> (Sp):</b> An aasimar can use <i>daylight</i> once per day as a 1<sup>st</sup>-level caster or a caster of his class levels, whichever is higher.</p>
