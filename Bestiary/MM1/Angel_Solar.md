Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned Outer Planes.

Angels can be of any good alignment. Regardless of their alignment, angels never lie, cheat, or steal. They are impeccably honorable in all their dealings and often prove the most trustworthy and diplomatic of all the celestials.

All angels are blessed with comely looks, though their actual appearances vary widely.

Angels speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, though they can speak with almost any creature because of their [[tongues]] ability.

A solar has a deep and commanding voice, and stands about 9 feet tall. It weighs about 500 pounds.


**Combat**


In combat, most angels make full use of their mobility and their ability to attack at a distance.


**Angel Traits:** An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Solars are puissant champions of good. Only the most powerful fiends approach their power.

Even more fearsome than their *+5 dancing greatswords* are their *+2 composite longbows* that create any sort of *slaying arrow* when drawn.

A solar's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned and epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Regeneration (Ex):** A solar takes normal damage from epic evil-aligned weapons, and from spells or effects with the evil descriptor.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[aid]], [[animate objects]], [[commune]], [[continual flame]], [[dimensional anchor]], greater [[dispel magic]], [[holy smite]]* (DC 21), *[[imprisonment]]* (DC 26), *invisibility* (self only), *[[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]]* (DC 19), *[[Compendium/Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]* (self only) *[[power word stun]], [[remove curse]]* (DC 20), *[[remove disease]]* (DC 20), *[[remove fear]]* (DC 18), *[[resist energy]], [[summon monster VII]], [[speak with dead]]* (DC 20) *, [[waves of fatigue]]* ; 3/day - *[[blade barrier]]* (DC 23), *[[earthquake]]* (DC 25), *[[heal]]* (DC 23), *[[Charm Monster Mass|mass charm monster]]* (DC 25), *[[permanency]], [[resurrection]], [[waves of exhaustion]]* ; 1/day - *[[Restoration Greater|greater restoration]]* (DC 24), *[[power word blind]]* , *[[power word kill]]* , *[[power word stun]], [[prismatic spray]]* (DC 24), *[[wish]]* . Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

The following abilities are always active on a solar's person, as the spells (caster level 20th): *[[detect evil]], [[detect snares and pits]], [[discern lies]]* (DC 21), *[[see invisibility]], [[true seeing]]* . They can be dispelled, but the solar can reactivate them as a free action.


**Spells:** Solars can cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. A solar has access to two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.
