## Description

<p>A typical hell hound stands 4-1/2 feet high at the shoulder and weighs 120 pounds.</p>
<p>Hell hounds do not speak but understand Infernal.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Hell hounds are efficient hunters. A favorite pack tactic is to surround prey quietly, then attack with one or two hounds, driving it toward the rest with their fiery breath. If the prey doesn't run, the pack closes in. Hell hounds track fleeing prey relentlessly.</p>
<p>A hell hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Hell hounds have a +5 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.</p>
<p>*They also receive a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent, due to their keen sense of smell.</p>
<p>
            <b>NESSIAN WARHOUND</b>
          </p>
<p>Nessian warhounds are coalblack mastiffs the size of draft horses, often fitted with shirts of infernal chainmail.</p>
<p>Nessian warhounds resemble hell hounds, except as otherwise noted.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 10-foot cone, once every 2d4 rounds, damage 3d6 fire, Reflex DC 21 half. The save DC is Constitution- based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fiery Bite (Su):</b> A Nessian warhound deals an extra 1d8 points of fire damage every time it bites an opponent, as if its bite were a flaming weapon.</p>
