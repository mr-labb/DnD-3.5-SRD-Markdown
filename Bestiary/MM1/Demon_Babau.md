## Description



Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it - even other demons.

A babau is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds.

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe first, hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly and then toy with the rest. When ambushing their opponents, they make excellent use of the combination of multiple attacks and sneak attacks.

A babau's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Sneak Attack (Ex):** A babau can make a sneak attack like a rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when the babau is flanking.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[darkness]], [[dispel magic]], [[see invisibility]]* , *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 7th.


**Protective Slime (Su):** A slimy red jelly coats the babau's skin. Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive goo, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature who strikes the babau with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage as well but can negate the damage with a DC 18 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.


**
*Summon Demon* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day a babau can attempt to summon 1 babau with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.


**Skills:** Babaus have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Search checks.
