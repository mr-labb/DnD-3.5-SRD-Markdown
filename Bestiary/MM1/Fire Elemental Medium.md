## Description

<p>
          </p>
<p>A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it.</p>
<p>Fire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A fire elemental is a fierce opponent that attacks its enemies directly and savagely. It takes joy in burning the creatures and objects of the Material Plane to ashes.</p>
<p>
            <b>Burn (Ex):</b> A fire elemental's slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus fire damage from the elemental's flaming body. Those hit by a fire elemental's slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. The burn save DC is 14. A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame. The save DC is Constitution- based.</p>
<p>Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the elemental's attack, and also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save.</p>
<p>The elemental is 8 ft tall and weights 2 lb.</p>
