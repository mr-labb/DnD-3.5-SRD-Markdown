An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental Plane of Air. By twisting its body and varying the cadence of its wingbeats, an arrowhawk can fly at top speed in any direction. A juvenile arrowhawk (1 to 10 years old) is about 5 feet long from beak to tail, with the body accounting for about one-third of that length. Its wingspan is about 7 feet, and it weighs about 20 pounds. An adult (11 to 40 years old) is about 10 feet long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of about 15 feet and a weight of about 100 pounds. An elder arrowhawk (41 to 75 years old) is about 20 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and a weight of about 800 pounds.

Arrowhawks speak Auran, but they are not usually talkative creatures.

COMBAT

Arrowhawks are extremely territorial and always hungry. They attack almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or trying to drive away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity ray, fired from the tail. The creature also bites, but it prefers to stay out of reach.


**Electricity Ray (Su):** An arrowhawk can fire this ray once per round, with a range of 50 feet.
