## Description

<p>The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling by a muscular "foot" at the top of its body. It can look like a stalactite, by holding its tentacles stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color to match almost any type of stony background.</p>
<p>A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of its head. It weighs about 30 pounds.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and wrapping its tentacles around the opponent's head. Once attached, it squeezes and tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle that misses its initial attack often flies up and tries to drop on the opponent again.</p>
<p>
            <b>Darkness (Su):</b> Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness as the <i>darkness</i> spell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a darkmantle must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent's head and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> A darkmantle can "see" by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within 90 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
<p>These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature's variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.</p>
