## Description

<p>Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic tendencies.</p>
<p>A kobold's scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is nonprehensile. Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds - at least two to one - or trickery; should the odds fall below this threshold, they usually flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.</p>
<p>They begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.</p>
<p>
            <b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> Kobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.</p>
