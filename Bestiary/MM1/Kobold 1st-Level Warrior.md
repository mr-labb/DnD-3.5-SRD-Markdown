Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic tendencies.

A kobold's scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is nonprehensile. Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.

COMBAT

Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds - at least two to one - or trickery; should the odds fall below this threshold, they usually flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.

They begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.


**Light Sensitivity (Ex):** Kobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a *daylight* spell.


**Skills:** Kobolds have a +2 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Profession (miner), and Search checks.

The kobold warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.


**Challenge Rating:** Kobolds with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level -3.
