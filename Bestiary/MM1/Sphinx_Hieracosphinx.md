## Description

<p>Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.</p>
<p>A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.</p>
<p>Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake attacks with its hind legs. Each sphinx's description provides its attack bonus and damage.</p>
<p>Hieracosphinxes can make short work of even the most dangerous opponents with their claws. They are not particularly intelligent, but are cunning enough to dive at their enemies from above with their flying ability.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +13 melee, damage 1d6+2.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Hieracosphinxes have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
