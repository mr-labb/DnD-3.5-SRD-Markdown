## Description

<p>A ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diameter. A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds.</p>
<p>Ghaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their <i>tongues</i> ability.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Ghaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight in their humanoid form, wielding incandescent <i>+4 holy greatswords.</i> If a ghaele desires mobility, it assumes its globe form and blasts the enemy with light rays.</p>
<p>A ghaele's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>aid, charm monster</i> (DC 17), <i>color spray</i> (DC 14), <i>comprehend languages, continual flame, cure light wounds</i> (DC 14),  <i>dancing lights, detect evil, detect thoughts</i> (DC 15), <i>disguise self, dispel magic, hold monster</i> (DC 18), <i>greater invisibility</i> (self only), <i>major image</i> (DC 16), <i>see invisibility, greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only); 1/day - <i>chain lightning</i> (DC 19), <i>prismatic spray</i> (DC 20), <i>wall of force.</i> Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> Ghaeles in humanoid form can cast divine spells as 14th-level clerics. A ghaele has access to two of the following domains: Air, Animal, Chaos, Good, or Plant (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.</p>
<p>
            <i>Typical Cleric Spells Prepared</i> (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 - <i>cure minor wounds, detect magic, guidance, light, resistance, virtue;</i> 1st - <i>bless,  calm animals*, command, divine favor, obscuring mist, sanctuary, shield of faith;</i> 2nd - <i>aid, align weapon, bear 's endurance, hold animal*, lesser restoration, remove paralysis,  zone of truth;</i> 3rd - <i>daylight, gaseous form*, prayer, remove curse, searing light, water breathing;</i> 4th - <i>death ward, dismissal, divine power, restoration, summon nature's ally IV (animal)*;</i> 5th - <i>control winds*, flame strike, raise dead, true seeing;</i> 6th - <i>banishment, blade barrier, chain lightning*, heal;</i> 7th - <i>animal shapes*, holy word, summon monster VII.</i></p>
<p>*Domain spell. Domains: Air and Animal.</p>
<p>
            <b>Gaze (Su):</b> In humanoid form - slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the <i>fear</i> effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Light Ray (Ex):</b> A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.</p>
<p>
            <b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form.</p>
<p>A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.</p>
<p>
            <b>Protective Aura (Su):</b> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, <i>t</i>his ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability,</i> both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics block.)</p>
<p>
            <b>Tongues (Su):</b> Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</p>
