A ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diameter. A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds.

Ghaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their *[[tongues]]* ability.

Combat

Ghaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight in their humanoid form, wielding incandescent *+4 holy greatswords.* If a ghaele desires mobility, it assumes its globe form and blasts the enemy with light rays.

A ghaele's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[aid]], [[charm monster]]* (DC 17), *[[color spray]]* (DC 14), *[[comprehend languages]], [[continual flame]], [[cure light wounds]]* (DC 14), *[[dancing lights]], [[detect evil]], [[detect thoughts]]* (DC 15), *[[disguise self]], [[dispel magic]], [[hold monster]]* (DC 18), *[[Invisibility Greater|greater invisibility]]* (self only), *[[major image]]* (DC 16), *[[see invisibility]], [[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only); 1/day - *[[chain lightning]]* (DC 19), *[[prismatic spray]]* (DC 20), *[[wall of force]].* Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Spells:** Ghaeles in humanoid form can cast divine spells as 14th-level clerics. A ghaele has access to two of the following domains: Air, Animal, Chaos, Good, or Plant (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.


*Typical Cleric Spells Prepared* (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 - *[[cure minor wounds]], [[detect magic]], [[guidance]], light, resistance, [[virtue]];* 1st - *bless, [[calm animals]]*, command, [[divine favor]], [[obscuring mist]], [[sanctuary]], shield of faith;* 2nd - *[[aid]], [[align weapon]], bear 's endurance, [[hold animal]]*, [[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]], [[remove paralysis]], [[zone of truth]];* 3rd - *[[daylight]], [[Compendium/Spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]]*, [[prayer]], [[remove curse]], [[searing light]], [[water breathing]];* 4th - *[[death ward]], [[dismissal]], [[divine power]], [[restoration]], [[Summon Natures Ally IV|summon nature's ally IV]] (animal)*;* 5th - *[[control winds]]*, [[flame strike]], [[raise dead]], [[true seeing]];* 6th - *banishment, [[blade barrier]], [[chain lightning]]*, heal;* 7th - *[[animal shapes]]*, [[holy word]], [[summon monster VII]].*

*Domain spell. Domains: Air and Animal.


**Gaze (Su):** In humanoid form - slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a *fear* spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the *fear* effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Light Ray (Ex):** A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.


**Alternate Form (Su):** A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form.

A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A *[[true seeing]]* spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.


**Protective Aura (Su):** Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, *t* his ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a *[[magic circle against evil]]* effect and a *[[Globe of Invulnerability Lesser|lesser globe of invulnerability]],* both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics block.)


**[[Tongues]] (Su):** Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a *[[tongues]]* spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
