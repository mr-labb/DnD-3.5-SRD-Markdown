## Description

<p>A blue dragon’s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.</p>
<p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.</p>
<p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems—especially sapphires.</p>
<p>
						<b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>120-ft. line, damage 24d8 electricity, Reflex DC 36 half.</p>
<p>
						<b>Create/Destroy Water (Sp): </b>3/day—as create water, but can also be used to destroy water. Caster level 7th; Will DC 25 negates.</p>
<p>
						<b>Crush (Ex): </b>Area 15 ft. by 15 ft.; Small or smaller opponents take 2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage, and must succeed on a DC 25 Reflex save or be pinned.</p>
<p>
						<b>Frightful Presence (Ex): </b>Creatures of 36 HD or less, within a radius of 330 ft. must succeed a Will save (DC 33). Creature that succeeds remains immune to that dragon’s frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.</p>
<p>
						<b>Sound Imitation (Ex): </b>Can mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on DC 25 Will saves to detect the ruse.</p>
<p>

					</p>
<p>Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.</p>
