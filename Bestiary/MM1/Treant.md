## Description

<p>A treant's leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant's legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree.</p>
<p>A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a "trunk" about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p>
<p>Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues - at least enough to say "Get away from my trees!"</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Animate Trees</i> (Sp):</b> A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to <i>liveoak</i> (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.</p>
<p>
            <b>Double Damage against Objects (Ex):</b> A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Trample (Ex):</b> Reflex DC 22 half. The save DC is Strength-based. Skills: *Treants have a +16 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas.</p>
