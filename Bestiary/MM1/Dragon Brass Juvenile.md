## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire (4d6 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 18) or a cone of sleep. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Will save (DC 18) or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds plus 4 rounds. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Fire Subtype (Ex): Fire immunity, double damage from cold except on a successful save.
