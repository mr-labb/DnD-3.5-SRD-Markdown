## Description



Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.

A dire bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200 pounds.

Combat

Dire bats swoop down upon unsuspecting prey from above.


**Blindsense (Ex):** A dire bat uses echolocation to pinpoint creatures within 40 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat unless it can actually see them.


**Skills:** Dire bats have a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.
