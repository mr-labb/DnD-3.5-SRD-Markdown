Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants.

A shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body.

A shambler's body has an 8-foot girth and is about 6 feet tall when the creature stands erect. It weighs about 3,800 pounds.

COMBAT

A shambling mound batters or constricts its opponents with two huge, armlike appendages.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a shambler must hit with both slam attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Constrict (Ex):** A shambler deals 2d6+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check.


**Immunity to Electricity (Ex):** Shamblers take no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack used against a shambler temporarily grants it 1d4 points of Constitution. The shambler loses these points at the rate of 1 per hour.

Skills: Shamblers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Move Silently checks. *They have a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks when in a swampy or forested area.
