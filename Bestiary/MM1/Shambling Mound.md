## Description

<p>Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants.</p>
<p>A shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body.</p>
<p>A shambler's body has an 8-foot girth and is about 6 feet tall when the creature stands erect. It weighs about 3,800 pounds.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A shambling mound batters or constricts its opponents with two huge, armlike appendages.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a shambler must hit with both slam attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A shambler deals 2d6+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Immunity to Electricity (Ex):</b> Shamblers take no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack used against a shambler temporarily grants it 1d4 points of Constitution. The shambler loses these points at the rate of 1 per hour.</p>
<p>Skills: Shamblers have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Move Silently checks. *They have a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks when in a swampy or forested area.</p>
