## Description

<p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces.</p>
<p>The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.</p>
<p>A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body parts, stitched together into a single composite form. No natural animal willingly tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500 pounds.</p>
<p>A flesh golem golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body.</p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem's body includes costly material components that may require some extra preparation. The golem's creator can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate skill, which varies with the golem variety.</p>
<p>Completing the golem's creation drains the appropriate XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.</p>
<p>The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>
<p>The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem's description.</p>
<p>
            <i>Note:</i> The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem's market price minus the cost of the special materials required.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.</p>
<p>A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem's creator can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else's control, and so on), but the golem's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.</p>
<p>
            <b>Berserk (Ex):</b> When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%.</p>
<p>
            <b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted. A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any <i>slow</i> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a flesh golem hit by a <i>lightning bolt</i> heals 3 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 11 points of damage. A flesh golem golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.</p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>The pieces of a flesh golem must come from normal human corpses that have not decayed significantly. Assembly requires a minimum of six different bodies - one for each limb, the torso (including head), and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required. Note that creating a flesh golem requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor.</p>
<p>Assembling the body requires a DC 13 Craft (leatherworking) check or a DC 13 Heal check.</p>
<p>CL 8th; Craft Construct, <i>animate dead, bull's strength, geas/quest, limited wish</i>, caster must be at least 8th level<i>;</i> Price 20,000 gp; Cost 10,500 gp + 780 XP.</p>
