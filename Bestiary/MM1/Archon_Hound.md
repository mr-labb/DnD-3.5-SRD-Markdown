Archons are celestials from a lawful good-aligned plane.

Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature because of their [[tongues]] ability.

Hound archons look like well-muscled humans with canine heads.

COMBAT

Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).


**Archon Traits:** An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Hound archons prefer to attack with their natural weapons but occasionally use greatswords.

A hound archon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[aid]], [[continual flame]], [[detect evil]], [[message]].* Caster level 6th.


**Aura of Menace (Su):** Will DC 16 negates.


**Change Shape (Su):** A hound archon can assume any canine form of Small to Large size. While in canine form, the hound archon loses its bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite attack of the form it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any doglike or wolflike animal of the animal type.


**Skills:** *While in canine form, a hound archon gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide and Survival checks.


**HOUND ARCHONS AS CHARACTERS**


Hound archon characters possess the following racial traits.
