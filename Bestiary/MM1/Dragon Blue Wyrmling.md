## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning (Reflex save DC 14 for half damage), damage 2d8. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If the dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Create/Destroy Water (Sp): The dragon can use this ability three times per day It works like the create water spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed at a will save (DC 13) or be ruined.
