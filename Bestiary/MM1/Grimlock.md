## Description



COMBAT

Grimlocks are blind, but their exceptional senses of smell and hearing allow them to notice foes nearby. As a result, they usually shun ranged weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone battleaxes.


**[[Blindsight]] (Ex):** Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment.

Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and [[Scent]]-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as *[[ghost sound]]* or *silence* ) and overpowering odors (such as *[[stinking cloud]]* or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.


**Immunities:** Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.


**Skills:** *A grimlock's dull gray skin helps it hide in its native terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains or underground.


**GRIMLOCKS AS CHARACTERS**
