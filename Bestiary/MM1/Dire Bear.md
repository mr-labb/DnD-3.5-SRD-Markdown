Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.

The omnivorous dire bear usually does not bother creatures that try to avoid it, but will aggressively defend a kill or other source of food. It will not hesitate to rip apart anything that might contain something edible.

A typical dire bear is 12 feet long and weighs as much as 8,000 pounds.

Combat

A dire bear attacks by tearing at opponents with its claws.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a dire bear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
