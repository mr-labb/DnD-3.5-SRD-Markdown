## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>The omnivorous dire bear usually does not bother creatures that try to avoid it, but will aggressively defend a kill or other source of food. It will not hesitate to rip apart anything that might contain something edible.</p>
<p>A typical dire bear is 12 feet long and weighs as much as 8,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A dire bear attacks by tearing at opponents with its claws.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a dire bear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
