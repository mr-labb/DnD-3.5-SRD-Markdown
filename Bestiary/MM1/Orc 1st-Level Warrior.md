## Description

<p>An orc's hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Their equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds.</p>
<p>Females are slightly smaller.</p>
<p>The language an orc speaks varies slightly from tribe to tribe, but any orc is understandable by someone else who speaks Orc. Some orcs know Goblin or Giant as well.</p>
<p>Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up the warrior or fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as a martial weapon. They enjoy attacking from concealment and setting ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as honoring a truce) only as long as it is convenient for them.</p>
<p>
            <b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.</p>
<p>ORCS AS CHARACTERS</p>
<p>
            <b>Orc Traits (Ex):</b> Orcs possess the following racial traits.</p>
<p>The orc warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
<p>HALF-ORCS</p>
<p>These orc-human crossbreeds can be found in either orc or human society (where their status varies according to local sentiments), or in communities of their own. Half-orcs usually inherit a good blend of the physical characteristics of their parents. They are as tall as humans and a little heavier, thanks to their muscle. They have greenish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair. Half-orcs who have lived among or near orcs have scars, in keeping with orcish tradition.</p>
