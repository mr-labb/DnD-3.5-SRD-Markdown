## Description



A typical lammasu is about 8 feet long and weighs about 500 pounds. Lammasus speak Common, Draconic, and Celestial.

COMBAT

A lammasu attacks with spells or its razor-sharp claws. It almost always enters combat if it observes a good creature being threatened by evil.


**Spells:** A lammasu casts spells as a 7th-level cleric, and can choose spells from the cleric spell list, plus any two of the following domains: Good, Healing, Knowledge, or Law.


**[[Magic Circle against Evil]] (Su):** A lammasu radiates a continuous [[magic circle against evil]] that affects a 20-foot radius.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 2/day - *greater invisibility* (self only); 1/day - *[[dimension door]]* . Caster level 7th.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a lammasu charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Skills:** Lammasus have a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.


**GOLDEN PROTECTOR (CELESTIAL HALF-DRAGON LAMMASU)**


Child of a celestial lammasu and a gold dragon, the golden protector has migrated to the Material Plane to more actively combat evil.
