## Description



Combat

Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with a frenzy of claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks.

A leonal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Roar (Su):** A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a *[[holy word]]* spell and deals an extra 2d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a leonal charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a leonal must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +20 melee, damage 1d6+8.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[detect thoughts]], [[fireball]]* (DC 15), *[[hold monster]]* (DC 17) *, [[Compendium/Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]], [[wall of force]];* 3/day - *[[cure critical wounds]]* (DC 16) *, [[neutralize poison]], [[remove disease]];* 1/day - *heal* (DC 18) *.* Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Lay on Hands (Su):** As the paladin class feature, except that each day, a leonal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.


**Protective Aura (Su):** Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the leonal. Otherwise, it functions as a *[[magic circle against evil]]* effect and a *[[Globe of Invulnerability Lesser|lesser globe of invulnerability]],* both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals leonal's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a leonal's statistics block.)


**[[Speak with Animals]] (Su):** This ability works like *[[speak with animals]]* (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require sound.


**Skills:** Leonals have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks.
