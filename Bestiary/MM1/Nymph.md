A nymph is about the height and weight of a female elf.

Nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.

COMBAT


**Blinding Beauty (Su):** This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the *blindness* spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day - *[[dimension door]].* Caster level 7th.


**Spells:** A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.


*Typical Druid Spells Prepared* (6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level): 0 - *[[cure minor wounds]], [[detect magic]], [[flare]], [[guidance]], light, resistance;* 1st - *[[calm animals]], [[cure light wounds]], entangle, [[longstrider]], [[speak with animals]];* 2nd - *[[barkskin]], [[heat metal]], [[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]], [[tree shape]];* 3rd - *[[call lightning]], [[cure moderate wounds]], [[protection from energy]];* 4th - *[[rusting grasp]].*


**Stunning Glance (Su):** As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Unearthly Grace (Su):** A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses).


**Wild Empathy (Ex):** This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.


**Skills:** A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.
