## Description

<p>A nymph is about the height and weight of a female elf.</p>
<p>Nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>
            <b>Blinding Beauty (Su):</b> This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the <i>blindness</i> spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.</p>
<p>The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day - <i>dimension door.</i> Caster level 7th.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.</p>
<p>
            <i>Typical Druid Spells Prepared</i> (6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level): 0 - <i>cure minor wounds, detect magic, flare, guidance, light, resistance;</i> 1st - <i>calm animals,  cure light wounds, entangle, longstrider, speak with animals;</i> 2nd - <i>barkskin, heat metal, lesser restoration, tree shape;</i> 3rd -  <i>call lightning, cure moderate wounds,  protection from energy;</i> 4th - <i>rusting grasp.</i></p>
<p>
            <b>Stunning Glance (Su):</b> As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Unearthly Grace (Su):</b> A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses).</p>
<p>
            <b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.</p>
