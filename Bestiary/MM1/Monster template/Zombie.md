"Zombie" is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature other than an undead (referred to hereafter as the "base creature"). The creature's type changes to Undead. It retains most type modifiers (such as Fire or Aquatic), but loses alignment type modifiers (such as Good) and type modifiers that indicate kind (such as Goblinoid or Reptilian). It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Hit Dice:** Drop any Hit Dice gained from experience, double the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12. If the base creature has more than 10 Hit Dice (not counting those gained with experience), it can't be made into a zombie with the _[[animate dead]]_ spell.

**Speed:** If the base creature can fly, its maneuverability rating drops to Clumsy.

**AC:** Natural armor increases to a number based on the zombie's size. (Use the base creature's natural armor, if it is higher). See Table 1.

**Attacks:** The zombie retains all the natural attacks, manufactured weapons, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A zombie also gains a slam attack. Recalculate the zombie's melee and ranged attack bonuses based on its new type (Undead) and abilities (+2 Strength, -2 Dexterity). Undead creatures have a base attack of HD x 1/2 (same as a wizard).

**Damage:** Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the zombie's size. (Use the base creature's slam damage if it's greater.) For purposes of Strength bonuses to damage, a slam attack is considered a two-handed attack. See Table 1.

**Special Attacks:** The zombie loses all special attacks.

**Special Qualities:** The zombie loses all special qualities except any subtypes it retains (such as the Fire subtype). The zombie gains the Undead type:

_Partial Actions Only (Ex):_ Zombies have poor reflexes and can perform only partial actions. Thus they can move or attack, but can only do both if they charge (a partial charge).

**Saves:** Base saves are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +2 +(1/2 HD) (same as wizard).

**Abilities:** The zombie's Strength increases by +2, it's Dexterity decreases by 2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma decreases to 1.

**Skills:** The zombie loses all skills.

**Feats:** The zombie loses all feats and gains Toughness.

**Climate/Terrain**: Any land and underground

**Organization**: Any
