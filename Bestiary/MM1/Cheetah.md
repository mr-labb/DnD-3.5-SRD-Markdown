## Description



Cheetahs are swift feline predators of the plains. A cheetah is 3 to 5 feet long and weighs 110 to 130 pounds.

Combat

Cheetahs make sudden sprints to bring down prey.


**Trip (Ex):** A cheetah that hits with a claw or bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the cheetah.


**Sprint (Ex):** Once per hour, a cheetah can move ten times its normal speed (500 feet) when it makes a charge.
