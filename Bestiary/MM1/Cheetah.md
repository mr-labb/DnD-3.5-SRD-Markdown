## Description

<p>Cheetahs are swift feline predators of the plains. A cheetah is 3 to 5 feet long and weighs 110 to 130 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Cheetahs make sudden sprints to bring down prey.</p>
<p>
            <b>Trip (Ex):</b> A cheetah that hits with a claw or bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the cheetah.</p>
<p>
            <b>Sprint (Ex):</b> Once per hour, a cheetah can move ten times its normal speed (500 feet) when it makes a charge.</p>
