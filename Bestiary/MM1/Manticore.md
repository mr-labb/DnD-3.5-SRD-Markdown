A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Manticores speak Common.

COMBAT

A manticore begins most attacks with a volley of spikes, then closes. In the outdoors, it often uses its powerful wings to stay aloft during battle.


**Spikes (Ex):** With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in any 24-hour period.


**Skills:** *Manticores have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.
