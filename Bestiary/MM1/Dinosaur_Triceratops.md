Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.

A triceratops has a body about 25 feet long and weighs about 20,000 pounds.

Combat

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get into charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and trample their opponents.

These creatures are likely to charge and skewer any creature of at least Large size that infringes on their territory. A triceratops uses its trample attack on smaller opponents.


**Powerful Charge (Ex):** When a triceratops charges, its gore attack deals 4d8+20 points of damage.


**Trample (Ex):** Reflex half DC 28. The save DC is Strength-based.
