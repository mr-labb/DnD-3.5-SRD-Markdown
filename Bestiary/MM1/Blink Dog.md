## Description

<p>The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation ability.</p>
<p>Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines, and growls that can transmit complex information.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take advantage of flanking.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blink (Su):</b> A blink dog can use <i>blink</i> as the spell (caster level 8th), and can evoke or end the effect as a free action.</p>
<p>
            <b>Dimension Door (Su):</b> A blink dog can teleport, as <i>dimension door</i> (caster level 8th), once per round as a free action. The ability affects only the blink dog, which never appears within a solid object and can act immediately after teleporting.</p>
