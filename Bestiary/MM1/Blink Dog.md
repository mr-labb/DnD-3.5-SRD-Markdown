## Description



The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation ability.

Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines, and growls that can transmit complex information.

COMBAT

Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take advantage of flanking.


**Blink (Su):** A blink dog can use *blink* as the spell (caster level 8th), and can evoke or end the effect as a free action.


**[[Dimension Door]] (Su):** A blink dog can [[teleport]], as *[[dimension door]]* (caster level 8th), once per round as a free action. The ability affects only the blink dog, which never appears within a solid object and can act immediately after teleporting.
