## Description

<p>A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.</p>
<p>
            <b>MYRMARCH</b>
          </p>
<p>Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath them, these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires, and creative thought.</p>
<p>A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are capable of fine manipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to signify its position (the more elaborate the helm, the more prestigious the position).</p>
<p>Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Myrmarchs' claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose.</p>
<p>Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks, coated with poison from their own stingers.</p>
<p>They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are present) and commanding them through the hive mind. If chaotic creatures are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.</p>
<p>A formian myrmarch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>charm monster</i> (DC 17), <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect chaos, detect thoughts</i> (DC 15), <i>magic circle against chaos</i>,  <i>greater teleport;</i> 1/day - <i>dictum</i> (DC 20), <i>order's wrath</i> (DC 17).
