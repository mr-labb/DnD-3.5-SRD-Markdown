## Description

<p>Massive herbivores of tropical lands, elephants are unpredictable creatures but nevertheless are sometimes used as mounts or beasts of burden.</p>
<p>This entry describes an African elephant. Indian elephants are slightly smaller and weaker (Strength 28), but more readily trained (Wisdom 15). These statistics can also represent prehistoric creatures such as mammoths and mastodons.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Elephants tend to charge at threatening creatures.</p>

            <b>Trample (Ex):</b> Reflex half DC 25. The save DC is Strength-based.</p>
