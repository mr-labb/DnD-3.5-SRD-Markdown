Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it - even other demons.

A dretch is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Dretches cannot speak but can communicate telepathically.

Combat

Dretches are slow, stupid, and not very effective combatants. In one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage reduction to keep them alive. In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome foes and immediately summon other dretches to improve the odds in battle. They flee at the first sign of adversity unless more powerful demons are present to intimidate them into fighting. Dretches' fear of their greater kin is stronger then even their fear of death.

A dretch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day - *[[scare]]* (DC 12), *[[stinking cloud]]* (DC 13). Caster level 2nd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**
*Summon Demon* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day a dretch can attempt to summon another dretch with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.


**Telepathy (Su):** Dretches can communicate telepathically with creatures within 100 feet that speak Abyssal.
