These long, lean carnivores are slightly taller than brown bears.

Combat

Polar bears fight just as brown bears do.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a polar bear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.


**Skills:** A polar bear has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A polar bear's white coat bestows a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks in snowy areas.
