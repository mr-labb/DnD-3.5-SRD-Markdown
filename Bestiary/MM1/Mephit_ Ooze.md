## Description

<p>Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.</p>
<p>All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.</p>
<p>Ooze mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Water. An ooze mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.</p>
<p>Ooze mephits speak Common and Aquan.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.</p>
<p>A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Mephit</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a <i>summon monster</i> spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 10-foot cone of caustic liquid, damage 1d4 acid, Reflex DC 13 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by itching skin and burning eyes unless they have immunity to acid or are otherwise protected. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Once per hour an ooze mephit can hurl an acidic blob that functions like <i>acid arrow</i> (caster level 3rd). Once per day it can create a mass of smelly fog that duplicates the effect of <i>stinking cloud</i> (DC 15, caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> An ooze mephit heals only if in a wet or muddy environment.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> An ooze mephit has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
