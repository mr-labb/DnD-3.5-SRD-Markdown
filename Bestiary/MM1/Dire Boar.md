Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.

Dire boars are omnivorous and spend most of their time rooting around, much as ordinary pigs do. They viciously attack anything that approaches them, however.

Dire boars grow up to 12 feet long and weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.

Combat

A dire boar charges its opponent, trying to rip the target open with its tusks.


            **Ferocity (Ex):** A dire boar is such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.
