## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>Dire boars are omnivorous and spend most of their time rooting around, much as ordinary pigs do. They viciously attack anything that approaches them, however.</p>
<p>Dire boars grow up to 12 feet long and weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A dire boar charges its opponent, trying to rip the target open with its tusks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Ferocity (Ex):</b> A dire boar is such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.</p>
