## Description



A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.

COMBAT

A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

A nightmare's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Flaming Hooves (Su):** A blow from a nightmare's hooves sets combustible materials alight.


**Smoke (Su):** During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all.


**[[Astral Projection]] and Etherealness (Su):** These abilities function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either at will.


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.
