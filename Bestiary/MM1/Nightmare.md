## Description

<p>A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p>
<p>A nightmare's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Flaming Hooves (Su):</b> A blow from a nightmare's hooves sets combustible materials alight.</p>
<p>
            <b>Smoke (Su):</b> During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all.</p>
<p>
            <b>Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su):</b> These abilities function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either at will.</p>
<p>
            <b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.</p>
