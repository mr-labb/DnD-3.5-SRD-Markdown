## Description

<p>An owlbear's coat ranges in color from brown-black to yellowish brown; its beak is a dull ivory color. A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Adventurers who have survived encounters with the creature often speak of the bestial madness they glimpsed in its red-rimmed eyes.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Owlbears attack prey - any creature bigger than a mouse - on sight, always fighting to the death. They slash with claws and beak, trying to grab their prey and rip it apart.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an owlbear must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
