## Description

<p>Minor xorns are about 3 feet tall and wide and weigh about 120 pounds.</p>
<p>Xorns speak Common and Terran.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Xorns do not attack fleshly beings except to defend themselves or their property, since they cannot digest meat. Xorns are indifferent to creatures of the Material Plane - with the sole exception of anyone carrying a significant amount of precious metals or minerals, which xorns eat. They can smell food up to 20 feet away. A xorn can be quite aggressive when seeking food, especially on the Material Plane, where such sustenance is harder to find than it is on its native plane.</p>
<p>A xorn's favorite mode of attack is to wait just beneath a stone surface until a foe comes within reach, then emerge suddenly. Groups of xorns often send one of their number to the surface to negotiate for food while the remainder position themselves for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>
            <b>All-Around Vision (Ex):</b> A xorn's symmetrically placed eyes allow it to look in any direction, providing a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks. A xorn can't be flanked.</p>
<p>
            <b>Earth Glide (Ex):</b> A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing xorn flings the xorn back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.</p>
