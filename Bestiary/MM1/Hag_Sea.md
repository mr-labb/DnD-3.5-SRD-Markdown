## Description

<p>Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they have many aspects in common. All take the form of crones whose bent shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.</p>
<p>Hags speak Giant and Common.</p>
<p>The sea hag is found in the water of seas or overgrown lakes.</p>
<p>A sea hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.</p>
<p>Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of the individual members.</p>
<p>Sea hags are not subtle and prefer a direct approach to combat.</p>
<p>They usually remain in hiding until they can affect as many foes as possible with their horrific appearance.</p>
<p>
            <b>Horrific Appearance (Su):</b> The sight of a sea hag is so revolting that anyone (other than another hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, taking 2d6 points of Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a victim's Strength score below 0, but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is helpless. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag's horrific appearance for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Evil Eye (Su):</b> Three times per day, a sea hag can cast its dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be dazed for three days, although <i>remove curse</i> or <i>dispel evil</i> can restore sanity sooner. In addition, an affected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or die from fright. Creatures with immunity to fear effects are not affected by the sea hag's evil eye. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Amphibious (Ex):</b> Although sea hags are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A sea hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
<p>From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.</p>
<p>A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a <i>veil</i> spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as <i>hag eyes</i> (see below).</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>animate dead, bestow curse</i> (DC 17)<i>, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana</i> (DC 18)<i>, polymorph, veil</i> (DC 19)<i>, vision.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities (which requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must participate.</p>
<p>Once per month, a covey that does not have a <i>hag eye</i> can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).</p>
<p>Hag Eye</p>
<p>A <i>hag eye</i> is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a <i>gem of seeing</i> or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a <i>hag eye</i> is worn as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the <i>hag eye</i> can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A <i>hag eye</i> has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a <i>hag eye</i> deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.</p>
