## Description

<p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
<p>Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.</p>
<p>Unlike other devils, erinyes appear attractive to humans, resembling very comely women or men. An erinyes stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.</p>
<p>Erinyes speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.</p>
<p>
            <b>Devil Traits:</b> Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Erinyes prefer to engage in combat from a distance. They use <i>charm monster</i> to distract or disorganize their opponents, then rain down fiery arrows from above.</p>
<p>An erinyes's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Entangle (Ex):</b> Each erinyes carries a stout rope some 50 feet long that entangles opponents of any size as an <i>animate rope</i> spell (caster level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty. Typically, an erinyes entangles a foe, lifts it into the air, and drops it from a great height.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>charm monster</i> (DC 19), <i>minor image</i> (DC 17), <i>unholy blight</i> (DC 19). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Devil</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day an erinyes can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d4 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>True Seeing (Su):</b> Erinyes continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).</p>
