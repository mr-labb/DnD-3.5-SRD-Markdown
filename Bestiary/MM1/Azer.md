## Description



Azers are dwarflike beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They wear kilts of brass, bronze, or copper, and speak Ignan and Common.

COMBAT

Azers use broad-headed spears or well-crafted hammers in combat. When unarmed, they attempt to grapple foes.

Although unfriendly and taciturn, azers rarely provoke a fight except to relieve a foe of gems, which they love. If threatened, they fight to the death, but they see the value of taking prisoners themselves.


**Heat (Ex):** An azer's body is intensely hot, so its unarmed attacks deal extra fire damage. Its metallic weapons also conduct this heat.

AZERS AS CHARACTERS

Azer characters possess the following racial traits.
