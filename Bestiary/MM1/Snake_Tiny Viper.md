## Description

<p>These creatures range widely in size. They are not particularly aggressive, but will often lash out with a bite attack before attempting to retreat.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Viper snakes rely on their venomous bite to kill prey and defend themselves.</p>
<p>Poison (Ex): A viper snake has a poisonous bite that deals initial and secondary damage of 1d6 Con. The save DC is 10. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A snake can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. Snakes use either their Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher. A snake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
