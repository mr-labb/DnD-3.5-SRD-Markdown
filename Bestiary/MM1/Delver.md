## Description

<p>A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about 6,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect its flanks while lashing out with its flippers.</p>
<p>A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2 inches thick.</p>
<p>The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to attack unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
            <b>Corrosive Slime (Ex):</b> A delver produces a mucuslike slime that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver's mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a delver's slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent's armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These save DCs are Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Stone Shape (Ex):</b> A delver can alter its slime to temporarily soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as a <i>stone shape</i> spell (caster level 15th).</p>
