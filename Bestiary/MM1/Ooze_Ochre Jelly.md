## Description

<p>Oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter - living or dead.</p>
<p>An ochre jelly can grow to a diameter of about 15 feet and a thickness of about 6 inches, but can compress its body to fit into cracks as small as 1 inch wide. A typical specimen weighs about 5,600 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Oozes attack any creatures they encounter. They lash out with pseudopods or simply engulf opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch or digest their prey.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> An ooze's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.</p>
<p>An ochre jelly attempts to envelop and squeeze its prey.</p>
<p>
            <b>Acid (Ex):</b> An ochre jelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> An ochre jelly deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an ochre jelly must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Split (Ex):</b> Slashing and piercing weapons and electricity attacks deal no damage to an ochre jelly. Instead the creature splits into two identical jellies, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 it points.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> An ochre jelly has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
