## Description

<p>A night hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.</p>
<p>Night hags speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Night hags attack good creatures on sight if the odds of success seem favorable.</p>
<p>These creatures rip through armor and flesh with their deadly teeth. They love to use <i>sleep</i> and then strangle those who are overcome by it.</p>
<p>A night hag's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Disease (Ex):</b> Demon fever - bite, Fortitude DC 18, incubation period 1 day, damage 1d6 Con. Each day after the first, on a failed save, an afflicted creature must immediately succeed on another DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, magic missile, polymorph</i> (self only), <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> (DC 12)<i>, sleep</i> (DC 12)<i>.</i> Caster level 8th. A night hag can use <i>etherealness</i> at will (caster level 16th) so long as it possesses its <i>heartstone</i> (see below). The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Dream Haunting (Su):</b> Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil individuals by using a special periapt known as a <i>heartstone</i> to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag invades someone's dreams, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.</p>
<p>HEARTSTONE</p>
<p>All night hags carry a periapt known as a <i>heartstone,</i> which instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a <i>heartstone</i> provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use <i>etherealness</i> until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the <i>heartstone</i>'s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected counts as a use) and it does not bestow <i>etherealness</i> to a bearer that is not a night hag. If sold, an intact <i>heartstone</i> brings 1,800 gp.</p>
