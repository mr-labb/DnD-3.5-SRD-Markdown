## Description

<p>Monstrous scorpions are likely to attack any creature that approaches, and they usually charge when attacking prey.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A monstrous scorpion deals automatic claw damage on a successful grapple check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a monstrous scorpion must hit with a claw attack. A monstrous scorpion can use either its Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for grapple checks, whichever is better.</p>
