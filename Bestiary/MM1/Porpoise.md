## Description

<p>Porpoises are mammals that tend to be playful, friendly, and helpful. A typical porpoise is 4 to 6 feet long and weighs 110 to 160 pounds. The statistics presented here can describe any small whale of similar size.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>
            <b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Porpoises can "see" by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this and forces the porpoise to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human's.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hold Breath (Ex):</b> A porpoise can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 6 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A porpoise has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A porpoise has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.</p>
