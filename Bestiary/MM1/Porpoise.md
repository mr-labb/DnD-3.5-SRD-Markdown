Porpoises are mammals that tend to be playful, friendly, and helpful. A typical porpoise is 4 to 6 feet long and weighs 110 to 160 pounds. The statistics presented here can describe any small [[Whale_Baleen|whale]] of similar size.

Combat


**Blindsight (Ex):** Porpoises can "see" by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A *silence* spell negates this and forces the porpoise to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human's.


**Hold Breath (Ex):** A porpoise can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 6 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.


**Skills:** A porpoise has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A porpoise has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.
