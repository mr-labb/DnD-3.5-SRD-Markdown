## Description



Monstrous scorpions are likely to attack any creature that approaches, and they usually charge when attacking prey.


**Constrict (Ex):** A monstrous scorpion deals automatic claw damage on a successful grapple check.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a monstrous scorpion must hit with a claw attack. A monstrous scorpion can use either its Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for grapple checks, whichever is better.


**Poison (Ex):** A monstrous scorpion has a poisonous sting. The Fortitude save DC is 12 and the poison causes 1 point of constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution- based. The indicated damage is initial and secondary damage.


**Skills:** A monstrous scorpion has a +4 racial bonus on Climb, Hide, and Spot checks.
