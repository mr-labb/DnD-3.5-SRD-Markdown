**Fanatical Advantage.** Once per day, dragonclaw may rerole a atack and damage, dealing using the best result


**Pack Tactics.** The dragonclaw has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonclaw’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
