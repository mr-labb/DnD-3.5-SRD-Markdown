## Description

<p>A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.</p>
<p>Minotaurs speak Giant.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them well.</p>
<p>
            <b>Powerful Charge (Ex):</b> A minotaur typically begins a battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the beast to make a single gore attack with a +9 attack bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Natural Cunning (Ex):</b> Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to <i>maze</i> spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.</p>
