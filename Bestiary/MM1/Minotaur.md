## Description



A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.

Minotaurs speak Giant.

COMBAT

Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them well.


**Powerful Charge (Ex):** A minotaur typically begins a battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the beast to make a single gore attack with a +9 attack bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.


**Natural Cunning (Ex):** Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to *maze* spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.


**Skills:** Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.


**MINOTAURS AS CHARACTERS**


Minotaur characters possess the following racial traits.
