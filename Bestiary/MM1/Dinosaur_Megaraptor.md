## Description



Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more colorful markings. Most dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.

This creature is a larger version of the [[Dinosaur_Deinonychus|deinonychus]], standing about 12 feet tall with a total length of 24 feet. It has the same appearance, habits, and abilities of the smaller version.

Combat

Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover until they can get into charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and trample their opponents.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a megaraptor charges, it can make a full attack.


**Skills:** A megaraptor has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen, Spot, and Survival checks.
