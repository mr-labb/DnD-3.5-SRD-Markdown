Breath Weapon (Su): Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning (16d6 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 29) or a cone of repulsion gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Will save (DC 29) or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 8 rounds. This is a mind-influencing compulsion enchantment. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Alternate Form(Su): A young or older bronze dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. A dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it wishes to assume a new one or return to its natural form. A true seeing spell or ability reveals the creature's natural form. A creature using alternate form reverts to its natural form when killed, but separated body parts retain their shape. A creature cannot use alternate form to take the form of a creature with a template.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 240 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (27).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 29) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
