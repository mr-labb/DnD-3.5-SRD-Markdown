## Description



A titan is about 25 feet tall and weighs about 14,000 pounds.

Titans speak Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic, and Giant.

COMBAT

A titan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Oversized Weapon (Ex):** A titan wields a great, two-handed warhammer (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[chain lightning]]* (DC 23), *[[charm monster]]* (DC 21), *[[cure critical wounds]]* (DC 21), *[[fire storm]]* (DC 24), *[[Dispel Magic Greater|greater dispel magic]], [[hold monster]]* (DC 22), *invisibility, [[invisibility purge]], [[levitate]], [[persistent image]]* (DC 22), *[[Compendium/Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]* (humanoid forms only, duration 1 hour); 3/day - *[[Compendium/Spells/Etherealness|etherealness]], [[word of chaos]]* (DC 22), *[[Summon Natures Ally IX|summon nature's ally IX]]* ; 1/day - *[[gate]], maze, [[meteor swarm]]* (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

In addition, titans of good or neutral alignment can use the following additional spell-like abilities: At will - *[[daylight]], [[holy smite]]* (DC 21), *[[remove curse]]* (DC 21); 1/day - *[[Restoration Greater|greater restoration]]* . Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Titans of evil alignment can use the following additional spell-like abilities: At will - *[[bestow curse]]* (DC 21), *[[deeper darkness]], [[unholy blight]]* (DC 21); 1/day - *[[crushing hand]]* (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND

Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt the foe with spell-like abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan's Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat, it can use *[[chain lightning]]* as a free action, and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this ability at the same time.


*Prior to combat: [[Invisibility purge]]* or *invisibility* .


*Round 1:* Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most dangerous foe. Hurl *[[chain lightning]]* at opponents standing away from the fight.


*Round 2:* Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl *[[chain lightning]]* at other opponents.


*Round 3:* Back away from first opponent and use *maze* or *[[meteor swarm]]* on any spellcaster causing trouble.


*Round 4:* Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or use *[[Dispel Magic Greater|greater dispel magic]]* on all nearby opponents.


*Round 5:* Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use *[[fire storm]]* .

Use another quickened *[[chain lightning]]* if foes seem really dangerous.

A titan usually reserves its *[[gate]]* and *[[Compendium/Spells/Etherealness|etherealness]]* abilities to escape a fight that is not going well.
