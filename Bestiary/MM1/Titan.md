## Description

<p>A titan is about 25 feet tall and weighs about 14,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Titans speak Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic, and Giant.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A titan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Oversized Weapon (Ex):</b> A titan wields a great, two-handed warhammer (big enough for Gargantuan creatures) without penalty.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>chain lightning</i> (DC 23), <i>charm monster</i> (DC 21), <i>cure critical wounds</i> (DC 21), <i>fire storm</i> (DC 24), <i>greater dispel magic, hold monster</i> (DC 22), <i>invisibility, invisibility purge, levitate, persistent image</i> (DC 22), <i>polymorph</i> (humanoid forms only, duration 1 hour); 3/day - <i>etherealness,  word of chaos</i> (DC 22), <i>summon nature's ally IX</i>; 1/day - <i>gate, maze, meteor swarm</i> (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>In addition, titans of good or neutral alignment can use the following additional spell-like abilities: At will - <i>daylight, holy smite</i> (DC 21), <i>remove curse</i> (DC 21); 1/day - <i>greater restoration</i>. Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>Titans of evil alignment can use the following additional spell-like abilities: At will - <i>bestow curse</i> (DC 21), <i>deeper darkness, unholy blight</i> (DC 21); 1/day -  <i>crushing hand</i> (DC 26). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>TACTICS ROUND-BY-ROUND</p>
<p>Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt the foe with spell-like abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan's Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat, it can use <i>chain lightning</i> as a free action, and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this ability at the same time.</p>
<p>
            <i>Prior to combat: Invisibility purge</i> or <i>invisibility</i>.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 1:</i> Charge and attempt to sunder the weapon of the most dangerous foe. Hurl <i>chain lightning</i> at opponents standing away from the fight.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 2:</i> Full attack against the disarmed opponent, and hurl <i>chain lightning</i> at other opponents.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 3:</i> Back away from first opponent and use <i>maze</i> or <i>meteor swarm</i> on any spellcaster causing trouble.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 4:</i> Sunder the weapon of the next most effective combatant, or use <i>greater dispel magic</i> on all nearby opponents.</p>
<p>
            <i>Round 5:</i> Full attack against any nearby opponent, or use <i>fire storm</i>.</p>
<p>Use another quickened <i>chain lightning</i> if foes seem really dangerous.</p>
<p>A titan usually reserves its <i>gate</i> and <i>etherealness</i> abilities to escape a fight that is not going well.</p>
