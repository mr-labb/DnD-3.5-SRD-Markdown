## Description

<p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces.</p>
<p>The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.</p>
<p>This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs.</p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar to creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem's body includes costly material components that may require some extra preparation. The golem's creator can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate skill, which varies with the golem variety.</p>
<p>Completing the golem's creation drains the appropriate XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.</p>
<p>The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>
<p>The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem's description.</p>
<p>
            <i>Note:</i> The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem's market price minus the cost of the special materials required.</p>
<p>A stone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs 5,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 17 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 17 Craft (stonemasonry) check.</p>
<p>CL 14th; Craft Construct, <i>antimagic field, geas/quest, symbol of stunning</i>, caster must be at least 14th level<i>;</i> Price 90,000 gp; Cost 50,000 gp + 3,400 XP.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless, they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.</p>
<p>A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem's creator can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else's control, and so on), but the golem's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.</p>
<p>
            <b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted. A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<p>Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and difficult to harm.</p>
<p>
            <b>Slow (Su):</b> A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell slows a stone golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all of its lost hit points.</p>
<p>A <i>stone to flesh</i> spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.</p>
