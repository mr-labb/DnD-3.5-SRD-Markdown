## Description



Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.

Earth mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

An earth mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds.

Earth mephits speak Common and Terran.

Combat

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Breath Weapon (Su):** A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.


**
*Summon Mephit* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a *summon monster* spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** 15-foot cone of rock shards and pebbles, damage 1d8, Reflex DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day - *[[soften earth and stone]]* . Caster level 6th.


**
*Change Size* 
**
**(Sp):** Once per hour, an earth mephit can magically change its size. This works just like an *enlarge person* spell, except that the power works only on the earth mephit. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Fast Healing (Ex):** An earth mephit heals only if it is underground or buried up to its waist in earth.
