## Description

<p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
<p>Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.</p>
<p>An ice devil is about 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Devil Traits:</b> Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>An ice devil prefers to fight only when doing so serves its mission, but it never hesitates to attack when it deems a battle necessary - or likely to end in its victory.</p>
<p>An ice devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> An ice devil can radiate a 10-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell (caster level 13th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ice devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Slow (Su):</b> A hit from an ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a <i>slow</i> spell for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>cone of cold</i> (DC 20), <i>fly, ice storm</i> (DC 19), <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>persistent image</i> (DC 20), <i>unholy aura</i> (DC 23), <i>wall of ice</i> (DC 19). Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Devil</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day an ice devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils, 2d4 bone devils with a 50% chance of success, or another ice devil with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> An ice devil takes normal damage from good-aligned weapons and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.</p>
