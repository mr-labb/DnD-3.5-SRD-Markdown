## Description



Genies are humanlike beings who dwell on the elemental planes. They are famous for their strength, guile, and skill with illusion magic.

The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Fire.

An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds.

Efreet speak Auran, Common, Ignan, and Infernal.

Combat

Genies prefer to outmaneuver and outthink their foes. They are not too proud to flee if it means they'll live to fight another day. If trapped, they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for their lives and freedom.


**
*[[Plane Shift]]* 
**
**(Sp):** A genie can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the genie and up to eight other creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level 13th).

Efreet love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do so for enjoyment as well as a battle tactic.


**
*Change Size* 
**
**(Sp):** Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an *enlarge person* or *[[reduce person]]* spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.


**Heat (Ex):** An efreeti's red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[detect magic]], [[produce flame]], [[pyrotechnics]]* (DC 14), *[[scorching ray]]* (1 ray only); 3/day - *invisibility, [[wall of fire]]* (DC 16); 1/day - grant up to three *wishes* (to nongenies only), *[[Compendium/Spells/Gaseous Form|gaseous form]], [[permanent image]]* (DC 18), *[[Compendium/Spells/Polymorph|polymorph]]* (self only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
