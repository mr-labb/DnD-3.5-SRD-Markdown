Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances without food or water.

The statistics presented here are for the dromedary, or one-humped camel, which thrives in warm deserts. A dromedary stands about 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with its hump rising 1 foot higher. The two-humped, or Bactrian, camel is suited to cooler, rocky areas. It is stockier, slower (speed 40 feet), and has a higher Constitution score (16).


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a camel is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds. A camel can drag 4,500 pounds.

Combat

*A camel's bite is treated as a secondary attack and adds only half the camel's Strength bonus to the damage roll.
