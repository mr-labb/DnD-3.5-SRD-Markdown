## Description

<p>Stone giants prefer thick leather garments, dyed in shades of brown and gray to match the stone around them. Adults are about 12 feet tall and weigh about 1,500 pounds. Stone giants can live to be 800 years old.</p>
<p>All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher also speak Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive two-handed weapons and wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant's favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.</p>
<p>Stone giants fight from a distance whenever possible, but if they can't avoid melee, they use gigantic clubs chiseled out of stone. A favorite tactic of stone giants is to stand nearly motionless, blending in with the background, then move forward to throw rocks and surprise their foes.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rock Throwing (Ex):</b> Adult giants are accomplished rock throwers and receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant of at least Large size can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to five range increments. The size of the range increment varies with the giant's variety. A Huge giant can hurl rocks of 60 to 80 pounds (Medium objects). The range increment is 180 feet for a stone giant's thrown rocks. It uses both hands when throwing a rock.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rock Catching (Ex):</b> A giant of at least Large size can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).</p>
<p>Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready for and aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.</p>
<p>A stone giant gains a +4 racial bonus on its Reflex save when attempting to catch a thrown rock.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> *A stone giant gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in rocky terrain.</p>
<p>
            <b>STONE GIANT ELDERS</b>
          </p>
<p>Some stone giants develop special abilities related to their environment. These giant elders have Charisma scores of at least 15 and spell-like abilities, which they use as 10th-level sorcerers. Once per day they can use <i>stone shape, stone tell,</i> and either <i>transmute rock to mud</i> or <i>transmute mud to rock</i> (DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based. One in ten elders is a sorcerer, usually of 3rd to 6th level.</p>
