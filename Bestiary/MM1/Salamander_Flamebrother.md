## Description

<p>Salamanders speak Ignan. Some average salamanders and all nobles also speak Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>If a salamander has damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A salamander deals automatic tail slap damage (including fire damage) with a successful grapple check. A noble salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided they are all at least two sizes smaller than it.</p>
<p>
            <b>Heat (Ex):</b> A salamander generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Salamanders' metallic weapons also conduct this heat.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a salamander must hit a creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Salamanders have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (blacksmithing) checks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Feats:</b> Salamanders have the Multiattack feat even though they do not have the requisite three natural weapons.</p>
