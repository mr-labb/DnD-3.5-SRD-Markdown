## Description



Salamanders speak Ignan. Some average salamanders and all nobles also speak Common.

COMBAT

If a salamander has [[Damage Reduction]], its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Constrict (Ex):** A salamander deals automatic tail slap damage (including fire damage) with a successful grapple check. A noble salamander can constrict multiple creatures simultaneously, provided they are all at least two sizes smaller than it.


**Heat (Ex):** A salamander generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Salamanders' metallic weapons also conduct this heat.


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a salamander must hit a creature of up to one size larger than itself with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.


**Skills:** Salamanders have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (blacksmithing) checks.


**Feats:** Salamanders have the Multiattack feat even though they do not have the requisite three natural weapons.
