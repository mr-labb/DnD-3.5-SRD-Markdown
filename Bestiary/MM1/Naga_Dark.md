## Description

<p>All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.</p>
<p>Dark nagas speak Common and Infernal.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange most encounters to suit their wishes.</p>
<p>Dark nagas prefer to fight from an elevated position where they get a good view of the battlefield while also staying out of reach.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 16 or lapse into a nightmare-haunted sleep for 2d4 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spells:</b> Dark nagas cast spells as 7th-level sorcerers.</p>
