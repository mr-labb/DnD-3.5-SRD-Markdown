## Description



All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic inner light.

Dark nagas speak Common and Infernal.

Combat

Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange most encounters to suit their wishes.

Dark nagas prefer to fight from an elevated position where they get a good view of the battlefield while also staying out of reach.


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 16 or lapse into a nightmare-haunted sleep for 2d4 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Spells:** Dark nagas cast spells as 7th-level sorcerers.

**[[Detect Thoughts]] (Su):** A dark naga can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 9th; Will DC 15 negates). This ability is always active. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Guarded Thoughts (Ex):** Dark nagas are immune to any form of mind reading.
