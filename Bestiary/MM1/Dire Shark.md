## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>Dire sharks attack anything they perceive to be edible, even larger creatures.</p>
<p>This monstrous fish can grow to a length of 25 feet and weigh more than 20,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Dire sharks bite with their powerful jaws, swallowing smaller creatures in one gulp.</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a dire shark must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe in the following round.</p>
<p>
            <b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> A dire shark can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of up to one size smaller by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1d8+4 points of acid damage per round from the shark's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out using a light slashing or piercing weapon by dealing 25 points of damage to the shark's digestive tract (AC 13). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.</p>
<p>A Huge dire shark's gullet can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium or Small, 32 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine or smaller opponents.</p>
<p>
            <b>Keen Scent (Ex):</b> A dire shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius and can detect blood in the water at a range of up to 1 mile.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A dire shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered.</p>
<p>It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
