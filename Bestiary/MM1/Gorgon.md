A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 8 feet from snout to tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.

Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack intruders on sight, attempting to trample, gore, or petrify them. There is no way to calm these furious creatures, and they are impossible to domesticate.

COMBAT

Whenever possible, a gorgon begins an encounter by charging at its opponents.


**Breath Weapon (Su):** 60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than five times per day), turn to stone permanently, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Trample (Ex):** Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is Strength-based.
