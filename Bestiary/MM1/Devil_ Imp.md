## Description

<p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
<p>Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.</p>
<p>In its natural form, an imp stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs about 8 pounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Devil Traits:</b> Most devils possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Imps are craven, but not so timid as to pass up an opportunity for a surprise attack using their <i>invisibility</i> and alternate form ability. In its natural form, an imp attacks with the wicked stinger on its tail. It quickly flies out of reach if a foe manages to strike back effectively.</p>
<p>An imp's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>detect good, detect magic, invisibility</i> (self only); 1/day - <i>suggestion</i> (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>Once per week an imp can use <i>commune</i> to ask six questions. The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).</p>
<p>
            <b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> An imp can assume other forms at will as a standard action. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that an imp does not regain hit points for changing form, and an individual imp can assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include monstrous spider, raven, rat, and boar.</p>
