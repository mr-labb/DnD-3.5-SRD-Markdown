Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.

Dire wolves are efficient pack hunters that will kill anything they can catch.

Dire wolves are mottled gray or black, about 9 feet long and weighing some 800 pounds.

Combat

Dire wolves prefer to attack in packs, surrounding and flanking a foe when they can.


**Trip (Ex):** A dire wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip its opponent (+11 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the dire wolf.


**Skills:** A dire wolf has a +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks.

*It also has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.
