## Description

<p>In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand.</p>
<p>Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their <i>tongues</i> ability.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads they most closely resemble.</p>
<p>A bralani's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -  <i>blur, charm person</i> (DC 13), <i>gust of wind</i> (DC 14), <i>mirror image, wind wall;</i> 2/day - <i>lightning bolt</i> (DC 15),  <i>cure serious wounds</i> (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Whirlwind Blast (Su):</b> When in whirlwind form, a bralani can attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A bralani can shift between its humanoid and whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like abilities and its weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.</p>
<p>A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any particular form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.</p>
<p>
            <b>Tongues (Su):</b> Bralanis can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</p>
