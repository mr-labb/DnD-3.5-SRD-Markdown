## Description



In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand.

Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their *[[tongues]]* ability.

Combat

Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads they most closely resemble.

A bralani's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[blur]], [[charm person]]* (DC 13), *[[gust of wind]]* (DC 14), *[[mirror image]], [[wind wall]];* 2/day - *[[lightning bolt]]* (DC 15), *[[cure serious wounds]]* (DC 15). Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**Whirlwind Blast (Su):** When in whirlwind form, a bralani can attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 16 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.


**Alternate Form (Su):** A bralani can shift between its humanoid and whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its whirlwind blast, but it can use its spell-like abilities and its weapons. In whirlwind form, it can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.

A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any particular form when killed. A *[[true seeing]]* spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.


**[[Tongues]] (Su):** Bralanis can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a *[[tongues]]* spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
