## Description



A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it.

Fire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so.

Combat

A fire elemental is a fierce opponent that attacks its enemies directly and savagely. It takes joy in burning the creatures and objects of the Material Plane to ashes.


**Burn (Ex):** A fire elemental's slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus fire damage from the elemental's flaming body. Those hit by a fire elemental's slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. The burn save DC is 11. A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame. The save DC is Constitution- based.

Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the elemental's attack, and also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save.

The elemental is 4 ft tall and weights 1 lb.
