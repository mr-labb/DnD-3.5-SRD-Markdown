## Description

<p>Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.</p>
<p>All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.</p>
<p>Earth mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Earth.</p>
<p>An earth mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds.</p>
<p>Earth mephits speak Common and Terran.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.</p>
<p>A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Mephit</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a <i>summon monster</i> spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
<p>
            <b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 15-foot cone of rock shards and pebbles, damage 1d8, Reflex DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p>
<p>Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day - <i>soften earth and stone</i>. Caster level 6th.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Change Size</i> (Sp):</b> Once per hour, an earth mephit can magically change its size. This works just like an <i>enlarge person</i> spell, except that the power works only on the earth mephit. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> An earth mephit heals only if it is underground or buried up to its waist in earth.</p>
