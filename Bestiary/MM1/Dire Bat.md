## Description

<p>Dire animals are larger, tougher, meaner versions of ordinary animals. Each kind tends to have a feral, prehistoric, or even demonic appearance.</p>
<p>A dire bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Dire bats swoop down upon unsuspecting prey from above.</p>
<p>
            <b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> A dire bat uses echolocation to pinpoint creatures within 40 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat unless it can actually see them.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Dire bats have a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.</p>
