## Description






Breath Weapon (Su): A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire (7d6 damage Reflex save for half damage DC 26) or a cone of sleep. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Will save (DC 26) or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds plus 7 rounds. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragon's mouth and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice.

Fire Subtype (Ex): Fire immunity, double damage from cold except on a successful save.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 210 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon (22).

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 24) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
