A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.

COMBAT

A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

A nightmare's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Flaming Hooves (Su):** A blow from a nightmare's hooves sets combustible materials alight.


**Smoke (Su):** During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all.


**[[Astral Projection]] and [[Compendium/Spells/Etherealness|Etherealness]] (Su):** These abilities function just like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either at will.


**CAUCHEMAR**


The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a nightmare. The sight of one of these great horrors bearing down is enough to shake the heart of the boldest champion.

COMBAT

The save DC for the cauchemar's smoke attack (DC 24) is adjusted for its greater number of Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.


**Carrying Capacity:** A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612 pounds; a medium load, 613-1,224 pounds; and a heavy load, 1,225-1,840 pounds.
