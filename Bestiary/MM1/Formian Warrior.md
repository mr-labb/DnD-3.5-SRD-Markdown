## Description

<p>A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.</p>
<p>
            <b>WARRIOR</b>
          </p>
<p>Warriors communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make reports to their commanders. They cannot speak otherwise.</p>
<p>A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 180 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once. Through the hive mind, they attack with coordinated and extremely efficient tactics.</p>
<p>A formian warrior's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
