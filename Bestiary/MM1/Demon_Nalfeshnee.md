## Description



Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it - even other demons.

A nalfeshnee can fly despite its small wings.

A nalfeshnee is more than 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

Combat

When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually disdain combat as being beneath them. Given the opportunity, they succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their smite ability and slaughter them while they can't fight back.

A nalfeshnee's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [[Damage Reduction]].


**Smite (Su):** Three times per day a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams play around its body. One round later they burst in a 60-foot radius. Any creature within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of its worst fears hound it. The creature receives its full Dexterity and shield bonuses to AC if attacked but can take no actions. Other demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *[[call lightning]]* (DC 18), *[[feeblemind]]* (DC 20), *greater [[dispel magic]], slow* (DC 18), *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), *[[unholy aura]]* (DC 23). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.


**
*Summon Demon* 
**
**(Sp):** Twice per day a nalfeshnee can attempt to summon 1d4 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous, or one glabrezu with a 50% chance of success, or another nalfeshnee with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.


**[[True Seeing]] (Su):** Nalfeshnees continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).


**Skills:** Nalfeshnees have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
