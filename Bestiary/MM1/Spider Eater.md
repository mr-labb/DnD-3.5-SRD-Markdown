## Description

<p>A spider eater is about 10 feet long and 4 feet high, and has a wingspan of about 20 feet. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A spider eater attacks with its venomous sting and powerful mandibles. Its usual tactic is to deliver a sting, then back off, hovering out of reach until the venom takes effect.</p>
<p>
            <b>Implant (Ex):</b> Female spider eaters lay their eggs inside paralyzed creatures of Large or larger size. The young emerge about six weeks later, literally devouring the host from inside.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial damage none, secondary damage paralysis for 1d8+5 weeks. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Freedom of Movement (Su):</b> Spider eaters have a continuous freedom of movement ability as the spell (caster level 12th). When the spider eater serves as a mount, this effect does not extend to its rider.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Spider eaters have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
<p>TRAINING A SPIDER EATER</p>
<p>A spider eater requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.</p>
<p>Training a spider eater requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a spider eater requires an exotic saddle. A spider eater can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p>
<p>Spider eater eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 3,000 gp to rear or train a spider eater.</p>
<p>
            <b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a spider eater is up to 306 pounds; a medium load, 307-612 pounds; and a heavy load, 613-920 pounds.</p>
