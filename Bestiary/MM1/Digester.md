## Description

<p>A digester stands about 5 feet tall and is 7 feet long from snout to tail. It weighs about 350 pounds,</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>A digester is a hunting and eating machine. When it is not hungry (which is rarely), it lies low and avoids most other creatures. When hunting, it looks about for a likely target, then charges forth and delivers a gout of acid. If the initial attack is insufficient to kill the prey, the digester attacks with its hind feet until it can spray acid again.</p>
<p>
            <b>Acid Spray (Ex):</b> A digester can spray acid in a 20-foot cone, dealing 4d8 points of damage to everything in the area. Once a digester uses this ability, it can't use it again until 1d4 rounds later.</p>
<p>The creature can also produce a concentrated stream of acid that deals 8d8 points of damage to a single target within 5 feet. In either case, a DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A digester's coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. It also has a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks.</p>
