## Description

<p>Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it - even other demons.</p>
<p>A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about 125 pounds.</p>
<p>Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they prefer to turn foes against one another. Succubi use their <i>polymorph</i> ability to assume humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a dungeon.</p>
<p>A succubus's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> A succubus drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus's kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a <i>suggestion</i> spell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect of the <i>suggestion</i>. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>charm monster</i> (DC 22), <i>detect good, detect thoughts</i> (DC 20), <i>ethereal jaunt</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>polymorph</i> (humanoid form only, no limit on duration), <i>suggestion</i> (DC 21), <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Summon Demon</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a succubus can attempt to summon 1 vrock with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.</p>
<p>
            <b>Tongues (Su):</b> A succubus has a permanent <i>tongues</i> ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). Succubi usually use verbal communication with mortals.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Succubi have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
<p>*While using her <i>polymorph</i> ability, a succubus gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks.</p>
