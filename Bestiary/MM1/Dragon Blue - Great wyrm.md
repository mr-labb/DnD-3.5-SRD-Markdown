## Description


A blue dragon’s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing desert sands. The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems—especially sapphires.


**Bite: **Bite attacks deal the indicated damage. A dragon also can use its bite to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat


**Breath Weapon (Su): **120-ft. line, damage 24d8 electricity, Reflex DC 37 half.


**Create/Destroy Water (Sp): **3/day—as create water, but can also be used to destroy water. Caster level 7th; Will DC 25 negates.


**Claw: **Claw attacks deal the indicated damage. The dragon also can use its claws to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat. Claw attacks are secondary attacks, requiring a –5 penalty on the attack roll. (Many dragons choose the [[Multiattack]] feat to lessen this penalty to –2)


**Crush (Ex): **Area 15 ft. by 15 ft.; Small or smaller opponents take 2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage, and must succeed on a DC 25 Reflex save or be pinned.

This special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents).

A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon’s body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don’t escape.



**Frightful Presence (Ex): **Creatures of 39 HD or less, within a radius of 360 ft. must succeed a Will save (DC 35). Creature that succeeds remains immune to that dragon’s frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.


**Grappling: **Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal grapple rules.

A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks.



**Tail Slap: **The dragon can slap one opponent each round with its tail. A tail slap deals the indicated damage and is treated as a secondary attack.


**Tail Sweep (Ex): **This special attack allows a dragon of at least Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon’s space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon).


**Wing: ** The dragon can slam opponents with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks deal the indicated damage and are treated as secondary attacks.


**Sound Imitation (Ex): **Can mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on DC 25 Will saves to detect the ruse.


**Spell-Like Abilities: **3/day—ventriloquism. Caster level 7th; save DC 13 + spell level.


**Spell Resistance : **31

Combat
**


Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.
