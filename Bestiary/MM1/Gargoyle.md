## Description

<p>Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving and use this disguise to surprise their foes. They require no food, water, or air, but often eat their fallen foes out of fondness for inflicting pain.</p>
<p>Gargoyles speak Common and Terran.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Gargoyles either remain still, then suddenly attack, or dive onto their prey.</p>
<p>A gargoyle's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Freeze (Ex):</b> A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice the gargoyle is really alive.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Gargoyles have a +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks. *The Hide bonus increases by +8 when a gargoyle is concealed against a background of stone.</p>
<p>
            <b>KAPOACINTH</b>
          </p>
<p>These cousins of the gargoyle have the aquatic subtype. They have a base land speed of 40 feet and a swim speed of 60 feet (no fly speed) and are found only in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>
