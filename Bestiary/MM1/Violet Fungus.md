COMBAT

Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey. When the shriekers' hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt.


**VIOLET FUNGUS**


Violet fungi resemble shriekers and are often found growing among them.

A violet fungi's coloration ranges from purple overall to dull gray or violet covered with purple spots.

Combat

A violet fungus flails about with its tentacles at living creatures that come within its reach.


**Poison (Ex):** Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
