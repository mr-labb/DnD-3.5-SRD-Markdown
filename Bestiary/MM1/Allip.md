## Description

<p>An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over the brink.</p>
<p>An allip cannot speak intelligibly.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>An allip is unable to cause physical harm, although it doesn't appear to know that. It keeps flailing away at enemies, yet it inflicts no wounds.</p>
<p>
            <b>Babble (Su):</b> An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>hypnotism</i> spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>
<p>Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Madness (Su):</b> Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Wisdom Drain (Su):</b> An allip causes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain each time it hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On each such successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
