## Description

<p>Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they have many aspects in common. All take the form of crones whose bent shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.</p>
<p>Hags speak Giant and Common.</p>
<p>Green hags are found in desolate swamps and dark forests.</p>
<p>A green hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often gather to form coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of the individual members.</p>
<p>Green hags prefer to attack from hiding, usually after distracting foes. They often use darkvision to their advantage by attacking during moonless nights.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>dancing lights, disguise self, ghost sound</i> (DC 12), <i>invisibility, pass without trace, tongues, water breathing.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Weakness (Su):</b> A green hag can weaken a foe by making a special touch attack. The opponent must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Mimicry (Ex):</b> A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near its lair.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> A green hag has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hag Covey</b>
          </p>
<p>From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually this foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.</p>
<p>A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised with a <i>veil</i> spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as <i>hag eyes</i> (see below).</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day - <i>animate dead, bestow curse</i> (DC 17)<i>, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana</i> (DC 18)<i>, polymorph, veil</i> (DC 19)<i>, vision.</i> Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. To use one of these abilities (which requires a full-round action), all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must participate.</p>
<p>Once per month, a covey that does not have a <i>hag eye</i> can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).</p>
<p>Hag Eye</p>
<p>A <i>hag eye</i> is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a <i>gem of seeing</i> or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a <i>hag eye</i> is worn as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the <i>hag eye</i> can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A <i>hag eye</i> has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a <i>hag eye</i> deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.</p>
