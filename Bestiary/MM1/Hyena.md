## Description

<p>Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their unnerving vocalizations. The statistics presented here are for a striped hyena, which is about 3 feet long and weighs about 120 pounds.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.</p>
<p>
            <b>Trip (Ex):</b> A hyena that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the hyena.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> *Hyenas have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth.</p>
