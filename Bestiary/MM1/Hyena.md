Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their unnerving vocalizations. The statistics presented here are for a striped hyena, which is about 3 feet long and weighs about 120 pounds.

Combat

A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.


**Trip (Ex):** A hyena that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the hyena.


**Skills:** *Hyenas have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth.
