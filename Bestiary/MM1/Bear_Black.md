## Description



The black bear is a forest-dwelling omnivore that usually is not dangerous unless an interloper threatens its cubs or food supply.

Black bears can be pure black, blond, or cinnamon in color and are rarely more than 5 feet long.

Combat

Black bears rip prey with their claws and teeth.


**Skills:** A black bear has a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks.
