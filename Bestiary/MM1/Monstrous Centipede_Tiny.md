## Description

<p>Monstrous centipedes tend to attack anything that resembles food, biting with their jaws and injecting their poison.</p>
<p>
            <b>Poison (Ex):</b> A monstrous centipede has a poisonous bite. The Fortitude save DC is 10 and the poison causes 1 point of dexterity damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The indicated damage is both initial and secondary damage.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Monstrous centipedes have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Climb and Hide checks. They can use either their Strength or Dexterity modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher. Monstrous scorpions can take 10 on Climb checks, even if threatened or distracted.</p>
