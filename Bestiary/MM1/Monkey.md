## Description

<p>The statistics presented here can describe any arboreal monkey that is no bigger than a housecat, such as a colobus or capuchin.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Monkeys generally flee into the safety of the trees, but if cornered can fight ferociously.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Monkeys have a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. They can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. They use their Dexterity modifier instead of their Strength modifier for Climb checks.</p>
