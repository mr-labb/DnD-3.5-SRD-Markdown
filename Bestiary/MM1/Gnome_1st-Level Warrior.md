## Description

<p>Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.</p>
<p>Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders, tinkers, or adventurers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin.</p>
<p>Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Gnomes prefer misdirection and deception over direct confrontation.</p>
<p>They would rather befuddle or embarrass foes (other than goblinoids or kobolds) than kill them.</p>
<p>Gnomes make heavy use of illusion magic and carefully prepared ambushes and traps whenever they can.</p>
<p>
            <b>Gnome Traits (Ex):</b> Gnomes possess the following racial traits.</p>
<p>The gnome warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p>
<p>SUBRACES</p>
<p>The information above is for rock gnomes, the most common variety.</p>
<p>There are two other major gnome subraces, which differ from rock gnomes as follows.</p>
<p>
            <b>Svirfneblin</b>
          </p>
<p>See the entry on Svirfneblin.</p>
<p>
            <b>Forest Gnome</b>
          </p>
<p>They are the smallest of all the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2-1/2 feet in height, but look just like regular gnomes except with bark-colored or gray-green skin, and eyes that can be brown or green as well as blue. A very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of 500 years.</p>
<p>
            <b>Forest Gnome Traits (Ex):</b> These traits are in addition to the rock gnome traits, except where noted.</p>
