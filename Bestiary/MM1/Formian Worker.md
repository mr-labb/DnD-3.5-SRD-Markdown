## Description

<p>A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.</p>
<p>
            <b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.</p>
<p>
            <b>WORKER</b>
          </p>
<p>While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can communicate just fine - although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.</p>
<p>A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.</p>
<p>A formian worker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Cure Serious Wounds</i> (Sp):</b> Eight workers together can heal a creature's wounds as though using the <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell (caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers.</p>
<p>
            <b>
              <i>Make Whole</i> (Sp):</b> Three workers together can repair an object as though using the <i>make whole</i> spell (caster level 7th). This is a fullround action for all three workers.</p>
