## Description

<p>These jungle cats are about 4 feet long and weigh about 120 pounds. They usually hunt at night. The statistics presented here can describe any feline of similar size, such as jaguars, panthers, and mountain lions.</p>
<p>Combat</p>
<p>
            <b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a leopard must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.</p>
<p>
            <b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a leopard charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p>
<p>
            <b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +6 melee, damage 1d3+1.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Leopards have a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks and a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Leopards have a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A leopard can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.</p>
