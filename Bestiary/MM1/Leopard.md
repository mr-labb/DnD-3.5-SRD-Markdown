Combat


**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a leopard must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.


**Pounce (Ex):** If a leopard charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.


**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +6 melee, damage 1d3+1.


**Skills:** Leopards have a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks and a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Leopards have a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A leopard can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. *In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8.
