## Description

<p>A yeth hound stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 400 pounds.</p>
<p>Yeth hounds cannot speak, but understand Infernal.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives depend on it.</p>
<p>A yeth hound's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Bay (Su):</b> When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures except other evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same hound's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Trip (Ex):</b> A yeth hound that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the yeth hound.</p>
<p>
            <b>Flight (Su):</b> A yeth hound can cease or resume flight as a free action.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> *A yeth hound has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.</p>
