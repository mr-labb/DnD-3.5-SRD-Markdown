A [[unicorn]] has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.

A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males.

Unicorns speak Sylvan and Common.

COMBAT

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.


**[[Magic Circle against Evil]] (Su):** This ability continuously duplicates the effect of the spell. A unicorn cannot suppress this ability.


**Spell-Like Abilities:** Unicorns can use *[[detect evil]]* at will as a free action.

Once per day a unicorn can use *[[Teleport Greater|greater teleport]]* to move anywhere within its home. It cannot teleport beyond the forest boundaries nor back from outside.

A unicorn can use *[[cure light wounds]]* three times per day and *[[cure moderate wounds]]* once per day (caster level 5th) by touching a wounded creature with its horn. Once per day it can use *[[neutralize poison]]* (DC 21, caster level 8th) with a touch of its horn. The save DC is Charisma-based.


**Wild Empathy (Ex):** This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check.


**Skills:** Unicorns have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks. *Unicorns have a +3 competence bonus on Survival checks within the boundaries of their forest.


**CELESTIAL CHARGER**


The celestial charger described here is an 8 HD celestial unicorn with seven levels of cleric.

COMBAT

The save DC for this celestial charger's [[neutralize poison]] ability (DC 20) is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and altered Charisma score.

A celestial charger's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.


**Smite Evil (Su):** Once per day a celestial charger can make a normal melee attack to deal 15 points of extra damage against an evil foe.


*Cleric Spells Prepared* (6/7/6/5/4; save DC 18 + spell level): 0- *[[detect magic]], [[detect poison]] (2), light, [[virtue]] (2)* ; 1st- *[[bless]] (2), [[calm animals]]*, [[obscuring mist]], [[remove fear]], [[sanctuary]], shield of faith* ; 2nd- *[[aid]]* (2), [[animal messenger]], [[Restoration Lesser|lesser restoration]], [[remove paralysis]], shield other* ; 3rd- *[[prayer]], [[protection from energy]], [[remove curse]], [[searing light]] (2)* ; 4th- *[[air walk]], [[divine power]], [[holy smite]]*, restoration* .

*Domain spell. Domains: Animal and Good.
