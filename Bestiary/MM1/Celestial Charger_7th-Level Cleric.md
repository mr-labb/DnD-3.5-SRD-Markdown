## Description

<p>A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.</p>
<p>A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males.</p>
<p>Unicorns speak Sylvan and Common.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.</p>
<p>
            <b>Magic Circle against Evil (Su):</b> This ability continuously duplicates the effect of the spell. A unicorn cannot suppress this ability.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Unicorns can use <i>detect evil</i> at will as a free action.</p>
<p>Once per day a unicorn can use <i>greater teleport</i> to move anywhere within its home. It cannot teleport beyond the forest boundaries nor back from outside.</p>
<p>A unicorn can use <i>cure light wounds</i> three times per day and <i>cure moderate wounds</i> once per day (caster level 5th) by touching a wounded creature with its horn. Once per day it can use <i>neutralize poison</i> (DC 21, caster level 8th) with a touch of its horn. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check.</p>
<p>
            <b>Skills:</b> Unicorns have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks. *Unicorns have a +3 competence bonus on Survival checks within the boundaries of their forest.</p>
<p>
            <b>CELESTIAL CHARGER</b>
          </p>
<p>The celestial charger described here is an 8 HD celestial unicorn with seven levels of cleric.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>The save DC for this celestial charger's neutralize poison ability (DC 20) is adjusted for its greater Hit Dice and altered Charisma score.</p>
<p>A celestial charger's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p>
            <b>Smite Evil (Su):</b> Once per day a celestial charger can make a normal melee attack to deal 15 points of extra damage against an evil foe.</p>
<p>
            <i>Cleric Spells Prepared</i> (6/7/6/5/4; save DC 18 + spell level): 0- <i>detect magic, detect poison (2), light, virtue  (2)</i>; 1st-<i>bless (2), calm animals*, obscuring mist, remove fear, sanctuary, shield of faith</i>; 2nd-<i>aid* (2), animal messenger, lesser restoration, remove paralysis, shield other</i>; 3rd-<i>prayer, protection from energy, remove curse, searing light (2)</i>; 4th-<i>air walk,  divine power, holy smite*, restoration</i>.</p>
<p>*Domain spell. Domains: Animal and Good.</p>
