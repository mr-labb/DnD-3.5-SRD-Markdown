## Description

<p>A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf 's, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons.</p>
<p>Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.</p>
<p>Dryads speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan.</p>
<p>COMBAT</p>
<p>Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring - they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad uses <i>charm person</i> or <i>suggestion,</i> attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.</p>
<p>
            <b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will - <i>entangle</i> (DC 13), <i>speak with plants, tree shape;</i> 3/day -  <i>charm person</i> (DC 13), <i>deep slumber</i> (DC 15), <i>tree stride;</i> 1/day - <i>suggestion</i> (DC 15)<i>.</i> Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.</p>
<p>
            <b>Tree Dependent (Su):</b> Each dryad is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not radiate magic.</p>
<p>
            <b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that the dryad has a +6 racial bonus on the check.</p>
